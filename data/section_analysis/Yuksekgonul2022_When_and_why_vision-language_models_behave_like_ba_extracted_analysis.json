    "Despite the use of large vision and language models (VLMs) in many downstream\napplications, it is unclear how well they encode the compositional relationships\nbetween objects and attributes",
    "Here, we create the Attribution, Relation, and Order\n(ARO) benchmark to systematically evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand\ndifferent types of relationships, attributes, and order information"
