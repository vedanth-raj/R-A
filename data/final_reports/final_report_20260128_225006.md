## Introduction

The field has experienced rapid growth in recent years, with increasing attention from researchers and practitioners alike. This growth has led to a proliferation of research approaches and methodologies, creating both opportunities and challenges. While significant progress has been made, important gaps remain in our understanding of key phenomena. The current literature lacks comprehensive synthesis of findings across different methodological approaches. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of 10 studies, offering insights into current trends and future directions. The significance of this research lies in its potential to consolidate knowledge and guide future investigations.

## Methods

This study employed a systematic review methodology to analyze 10 research papers. Papers were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria focusing on relevance and methodological rigor. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers using a standardized form. Quality assessment was conducted using established guidelines to ensure the reliability of included studies. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and synthesis of findings across studies. The review protocol was registered and followed PRISMA guidelines for transparency and reproducibility. This approach ensures comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the current state of research.
