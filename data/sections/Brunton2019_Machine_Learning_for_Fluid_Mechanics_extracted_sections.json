    "content": "Fluid mechanics has traditionally dealt with massive amounts of data from experiments,\nﬁeld measurements, and large-scale numerical simulations. Big data has been a reality in\nﬂuid mechanics (Pollard et al. 2016) over the last decade due to high-performance comput-\ning architectures and advances in experimental measurement capabilities. Over the past 50\nyears many techniques were developed to handle data of ﬂuid ﬂows, ranging from advanced\nalgorithms for data processing and compression, to datab...",
