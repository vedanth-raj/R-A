Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plants and humans. Nearly 50% of the
agriculture soils of world are Zn-deﬁcient. The low availability of Zn reduces the yield
and quality of the crops. The zinc-regulated, iron-regulated transporter-like proteins
(ZIP) family and iron-regulated transporters (IRTs) are involved in cellular uptake of
Zn, its intracellular trafﬁcking and detoxiﬁcation in plants. In addition to Zn, ZIP family
transporters also transport other divalent metal cations (such as Cd2+, Fe2+, and
Cu2+). ZIP transporters play a crucial role in biofortiﬁcation of grains with Zn. Only a very
limited information is available on structural features and mechanism of Zn transport of
plant ZIP family transporters. In this article, we present a detailed account on structure,
function, regulations and phylogenetic relationships of plant ZIP transporters. We give
an insight to structure of plant ZIPs through homology modeling and multiple sequence
alignment with Bordetella bronchiseptica ZIP (BbZIP) protein whose crystal structure
has been solved recently. We also provide details on ZIP transporter genes identiﬁed
and characterized in rice and other plants till date. Functional characterization of plant
ZIP transporters will help for the better crop yield and human health in future.

INTRODUCTION
In agriculture, the low availability of nutrients has reduced the crop production. The optimal supply
of micro-nutrients in soil solutions is vital for normal agriculture production. Zinc (Zn) is one of
the most essential micronutrients; it is irreplaceable for plant growth and metabolism (Marschner,
1995, 2011). Both deﬁcient and excess Zn has impaired the physiological and biochemical process of
the plant (Cakmak, 2000; Marichali et al., 2014). Zn deﬁciency is one of the most serious problems
worldwide reducing quality of crops (Ruel and Bouis, 1998; Sadeghzadeh, 2013), apart from yield
loss and the reduced Zn content in grains (Krithika and Balachandar, 2016). Soil Zn deﬁciency and
human Zn deﬁciency are often closely associated (Cakmak, 2008). Zn deﬁciency has been a major
cause of death for children in many countries (Black et al., 2008). Regmi et al. (2010) reported that
the lack of Zn was a major nutritional problem in humans; more than 3 billion world population
were aﬀected by various health problems due to low supply of Zn in their food. For example,
approximately 50% of the paddy ﬁeld is Zn deﬁcient and rice grown on these soils usually produces
very less yield with poor nutritional quality (Krithika and Balachandar, 2016). It was estimated that

the Zn suﬃcient rice plant had 40 mg/kg of Zn in its grains,
whereas under Zn deﬁcient condition it showed only 10 mg/kg of
Zn (Wissuwa et al., 2008). All over the world, 50% of agriculture
soils are Zn deﬁcient (FAO, 2000). Zn deﬁciency was observed
in a wide range of soil types such as high pH calcareous soils,
sandy soils, and high phosphorus (P) fertilized soils (Marschner,
1995). In 1972, the United States considered Zn deﬁciency as the
most common micronutrient deﬁciency in crops (Lindsay, 1972).
Zn deﬁciency is one of the major limiting factors aﬀecting crop
production badly. So, improving crop varieties with Zn eﬃciency
is helpful to overcome the Zn deﬁciency problem.
To overcome low Zn availability, plants have evolved a
complex array of tightly controlled adaptive mechanisms. The
Zinc-regulated, Iron-regulated transporter-like Protein (ZIP)
family has been identiﬁed and characterized in prokaryotes,
eukaryotes, and archaeotes and has been validated to be involved
in metal uptake and transport including Zn2+ (Grotz and
Guerinot, 2006; Kavitha et al., 2015). The presence of ZIP
transporters in such a diverse organism indicates their pivotal
role in Zn homeostasis. The ZIP family has a major role in
Zn transport and metal homeostasis in plants. Besides Zn2+,
ZIP transporters are reported to be involved in the transport
of other transition metal cations such as manganese (Mn2+),
iron (Fe2+), cadmium (Cd2+), cobalt (Co2+), copper (Cu2+),
and nickel (Ni2+) (Pedas and Husted, 2009). The iron-regulated
transporters (IRTs) are the major Fe transporters; they are
members of the ZIP family transporters (Eide et al., 1996; Conte
and Walker, 2011). The AtIRT1 is identiﬁed as the key Fe2+
transporter in Arabidopsis. The AtIRT1 (Eide et al., 1996), AtIRT2
(Vert et al., 2001), and AtIRT3 (Lin et al., 2009) transporters
are seem to be functioning for Fe2+ uptake and transport in
Arabidopsis. IRTs of Arabidopsis has the ability to transport
several divalent metal ions such as Zn2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+
(Eide et al., 1996; Vert et al., 2001; Chiang et al., 2006; Lee
and An, 2009; Lin et al., 2009). The IRTs genes are found
to be expressing under diﬀerent metal stress conditions with
increased expression levels under Fe deﬁciency. ZIP transporters
balance the uptake, utilization, and storage of Zn2+ under Zn
stress condition (Ramesh et al., 2003; Palmgren et al., 2008).
The ZIP transporters are also located in various cell organelles
and they are actively involved in Zn homeostasis and plant’s
adaptation to low and high Zn soils (Tiong et al., 2015). In
crops, most of the ZIP transporters are poorly understood with
only ZIPs of a few plants have been functionally characterized
(Kavitha et al., 2015). The detailed analysis of the structure of
the plant ZIP transporter is still lacking. Recently, the crystal
structure of the ZIP protein was deduced from a bacterium
Bordetella bronchiseptica and its metal transport mechanism
was also predicted (Zhang et al., 2017). So, in this article, we
present the details on the structure, mechanism and phylogenetic
relationships of plant ZIP transporters. We provided insight
into the structure of plant ZIPs through homology modeling
and multiple sequence alignment using B. bronchiseptica ZIP
(BbZIP) protein as a template. These ﬁndings would be a valuable
theoretical knowledge for future studies on Zn transporters in
crops. We also present details on ZIP transporter genes identiﬁed
and characterized till date in various plants.
ROLE OF Zn IN CROPS
Zinc is one of the eight essential micronutrients in plants (Hänsch
and Mendel, 2009). In crops, Zn deﬁciency was ﬁrst identiﬁed in
rice on calcareous soils in India (Nene, 1966; Yoshida and Tanaka,
1969). Plant cells require optimum levels of Zn for normal
physiological functions. Zn is involved in the maintenance of the
structural and functional integrity of biological membrane and
facilitation of protein synthesis, gene expression and regulation
and defense against disease (Cakmak, 2000; Andreini et al., 2006;
Sadeghzadeh, 2013). Also, it is involved as a structural, catalytic,
and intracellular and intercellular signaling component and Zn
is the only metal required for the activity of all six classes of
the enzymes (Sadeghzadeh, 2013). Especially Zn is essential for
the activity of metallo-enzymes that are involved in protein and
nucleic acid metabolism (Eide, 2006).
Zinc is needed by a small quantity (0.5–2 µM) from the
soil for the normal plant function (Krishna et al., 2017), but
yet crucial for many physiological and metabolic pathways
(Chen et al., 2008). In rice, 1.5 µM Zn is an optimum level
for growth on agar nutrient solution (Impa et al., 2013). Zn
content less than 15–20 µg per gram of dry leaf tissues of the
plant is a sign of Zn deﬁciency (Mitra, 2015). Zn is actively
involved in speciﬁc reactions of metabolic pathways, such as
tryptophan biosynthesis, which in turn is the precursor of
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and other phytohormones. In plants,
Zn2+ ions are directly involved in the synthesis of tryptophan
and auxin (Horak and Trˇcka, 1976; Marschner, 2011). Zn
deﬁciency decreases the level of phytohormones such as auxin,
abscisic acid, gibberellins, and cytokinin’s (Kumar et al., 2016). It
signiﬁcantly aﬀects the plant cell division, cell enlargement, and
diﬀerentiation (Skoog, 1940; Tsui, 1948). Cakmak et al. (1989)
observed that under Zn deﬁcient condition, the level of IAA in
the shoot tips and young leaves of bean was reduced to 50%
of that in Zn suﬃcient condition. Zn deﬁciency reduces the
plant growth, yield, and quality in crops such as rice (Chen
et al., 2008), mungbean (Samreen et al., 2017), and maize
(Wang and Jin, 2005). Zn deﬁciency decreases the activity
of key photosynthetic enzymes, namely carbonic anhydrase,
(Brown et al., 1993) which is crucial for crop production (Ali
et al., 2008; Mousavi, 2011; Xi-wen et al., 2011). The Zn
deﬁciency induces male sterility in maize (Sharma et al., 1987)
and wheat (Sharma et al., 1979). Ekiz et al. (1998) noticed
that the crops such as wheat, oat, barley, and triticale show
signiﬁcant decrease in growth and grain yield under Zn-deﬁcient
conditions. Zn is a not replaceable micro-nutrient for crops.
Zn deﬁciency is a common problem in all parts of the globe.
Therefore, much more research is necessary for improving Zn
use eﬃciency in crops for growth and higher yields under Zn
deﬁcient soils.
ROLE OF ZIP TRANSPORTERS IN Zn
TRANSPORT
In plants, Zn is acquired and transported predominantly as Zn2+
(divalent). Zn ions can also be bound with root exudates like

malate, citrate, oxalate and other low molecular weight organic
acids which aided to move toward the root surface area (Suzuki
et al., 2006). The charged Zn2+ ion do not freely diﬀuse across
the lipid bilayer membranes (Eide, 2005). Zn ﬁrst enters the
root cell wall’s free space by a diﬀusion process from the soil
solutions (Hacisalihoglu and Kochian, 2003). Transport of Zn2+
into the cortex takes place via symplastic or apoplastic pathway
(Kumar et al., 2016). The Zn transporter proteins are required
to carry Zn2+ into the cells and transport out of intracellular
compartments. They include a low-aﬃnity (Km = 2–5 µM) and
high-aﬃnity (Km = 0.6–2 nM) membrane transporter systems
(Hacisalihoglu et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2016). The high-
aﬃnity transporter system is dominantly active under low Zn soil
(Hacisalihoglu et al., 2001). The ZIP and IRT transporters help to
carry Zn2+ ions across cellular membranes into the cytoplasm
(Eide et al., 1996; Eide, 2005; Krishna et al., 2017). After that
Zn2+ ions pass the casparian band, endodermis and xylem
parenchyma cells which subsequently loaded into the xylem.
The heavy metal ATPase 2 (HMA2) and HMA4 transporters
of P-type ATPase family are involved in xylem loading of Zn
from the xylem parenchymatous cells (Hussain et al., 2004;
Hanikenne et al., 2008). The ZIP family transporters are mainly
involved in up take, transport and distribution of Zn in the whole
plant. The presence of ZIP transporters in a diverse organism
indicates their importance in Zn transport and homeostasis.
Therefore, understanding of their expression levels, localization,
and function in crops is essential. The functional genomics and
biotechnological approaches can be used to develop Zn deﬁciency
tolerant crops in the future. It assists in improving the quality and
quantity of crops especially enrichment of Zn content in grains
and to overcome Zn deﬁciency problems worldwide. The ZIP
transporter families can be used for genetic modiﬁcation in crops
to improve the fortiﬁcation of Zn.
STRUCTURE OF THE ZIP
TRANSPORTER
Only a very limited information is available on structural
features and mechanism of Zn transport of plant ZIP family
transporters. Plant ZIP family transporters are predicted to have
6–9 transmembrane (TM) domains (α-helices) with 8 being the
most prevalent form (Guerinot, 2000). The molecular weight of
the Zn transporters ranged from 33.1 to 51.4 kDa and protein
sequence ranged from 322 to 478 amino acids (Vatansever
et al., 2016). Understanding the mechanism of ZIP transporters
requires their high-resolution crystal structures. The crystal
structure of the plant ZIP protein is not yet available. However,
recently, a high-resolution crystal structure of prokaryotic ZIP
protein was deduced from a bacterium B. bronchiseptica and its
metal (Cd2+ and Zn2+) transport mechanism was also predicted
(Zhang et al., 2017). The crystal structure of BbZIP transporter
protein showed eight TM domains (TM1–TM8). The structure
of BbZIP was deduced with an inward-open conﬁrmation
and occluded at the extracellular side with a binuclear metal
center located in the center. The eight TMs formed a closely
associated α-helix bundle. The ﬁrst three TMs (TM1–TM3)
can be superimposed on the last three TMs (TM6–TM8) by
rotating 180◦, and TM4 and TM5 are symmetrically related and
sandwiched by the two 3 TM repeats (Zhang et al., 2017). The
binuclear metal center is formed by TM4 and TM5 with several
conserved amino acid residues (His177, Asn178, Pro180, Glu181,
and Gly182) and metal-binding motifs (Gln207, Asp/Asn208,
Pro210, Glu211, and Gly212). The structure of the BbZIP showed
four Cd2+ and seven Zn2+ metal-binding sites (Zhang et al.,
2017). The topology of BbZIP shows that both the N and the C
termini are exposed to the extracellular space and the putative
metal transport pathway found at the extracellular side is blocked
by hydrophobic residues of the TM2 (Met99 and Ala102), TM5
(Leu200 and Iso204), and TM7 (Met269) (Zhang et al., 2017).
The invariant Ser106 on TM2 is situated on the bottom of the
shallow and negatively charged entrance cavity, it is important
for guiding metals into the transport pathway. Two invariant
metal-chelating residues Asp113 and Asp305 present in the
entrance cavity have been predicted to be crucial for recruiting
metal substrates. The BbZIP structure shows multiple conserved
metal-binding sites near the metal exit cavity, indicating that
these constitute a route of metal release to the cytoplasm. The
bound metal released into the cytoplasm through a chain of
metal-chelating residues such as His177, Glu276, His275, Pro180,
Pro210, and Asp144 (Zhang et al., 2017). The Zn2+ binding
is penta coordinated by Glu181, Gln207, and Glu211 and two
molecules of water (Zhang et al., 2017). This structure provides
a model to analyze the plant ZIP transporters. So we have used
this as a template to model and analyze the residues in plant
ZIP transporters.
Comparison of Metal Binding Residues
in BbZIP and Plant ZIPs
We have analyzed the BbZIP protein sequence with plant ZIP
transporters such as Arabidopsis (12 ZIPs), rice (12 ZIPs),
and maize (10 ZIPs) through a ClustalW alignment (Tamura
et al., 2013). The functional residues of the BbZIP and their
corresponding plant ZIP residues are presented in Figure 1. We
have also included the complete alignment ﬁle (Supplementary
Figure S1). Except a few, most of the functional residues of
Arabidopsis, rice and maize ZIP protein sequences are not
conserved/homologous with BbZIP. But it is interesting to
see that all the plant ZIP protein sequences (expect AtZIP10
and OsZIP16) have conserved His117 residue found in BbZIP
(Figure 1). In AtZIP10 (Gln222) and OsZIP13 (Gln140) BbZIP’s
His177 is replaced by Gln. Gly182 of BbZIP is conserved
in all plant ZIPs (Figure 1). The His177 and Gly182 are
involved in the metal release from the metal-binding site of
the BbZIP. Similarly, Glu211 and Gly212 are metal-binding
residues in BbZIP. Glu211 of BbZIP is conserved in all plant
ZIP proteins expect for AtZIP2 (Ala243), AtZIP11 (Ala215),
OsZIP1 (Ala242), and OsZIP2 (Ala247) where Glu is replaced
by Ala. Similarly, expect AtZIP2 (Ala224), AtZIP11 (Ala216),
OsZIP1 (Ala243), and OsZIP2 (Ala248), other plants ZIP
transporter proteins possess conserved Gly212 of BbZIP. Another
interesting observation is that metal-binding site residues such as
Asn178, Pro180, and Pro210 are conserved only with OsZIP13,

OsZIP16, and ZmZIP6 of plants (Figure 1). Metal binding
site residues Gln207 and Asp208 and metal-chelating residue
Asp305 are not conserved with any other plant ZIPs. The
Gln207 is replaced by His residue in all plant ZIPs (Figure 1).
An invariable Ser106 is an important residue for guiding
metals into the transport pathway of the BbZIP. In plants,
Ser is completely replaced by His or Asp residue with His
being a dominant residue. Overall, the metal binding and
transport residues of OsZIP13, OsZIP16, and ZmZIP6 are
more conserved with BbZIP compared to other plant ZIPs.
These variations indicated that plant ZIP transporters may have
partially overlapping but distinct metal transport mechanism
compared to BbZIP as some of the residues involved in metal
binding and transport are not conserved in plant ZIPs. We have
also done homology modeling of plant ZIPs whose details are
discussed below.
Homology Modeling of Plant ZIP
Transporters
In order to gain more insights to the structure of plant
ZIP transporters, we have modeled some of the plant ZIP
transporters by homology modeling using BbZIP (PDB Id:
5TSA) as a template with Zn2+ as a ligand. The models

FIGURE 2 | Homology modeling of plant ZIP transporters using Bordetella bronchiseptica ZIP (BbZIP) (PDB ID: 5TSA) as a template. The BbZIP structure was
visualized using LiteMol viewer (https://www.litemol.org/Viewer/). Both whole model (A) and its Zn2+ binding site (B) is shown for each ZIP. The protein sequences
of plant ZIPs were obtained from phytozome website (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html). The homology models of the plant ZIP proteins were generated
using Modeler v9.22 (Eswar et al., 2007), which created 100 models for each target protein. The models were then ranked based on their modeler objective function
value. The ﬁve best models were analyzed using MolProbity (http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/), an online tool. Ramachandran plots were generated for these ﬁve
models and ﬁnally the best model was chosen based on the% residues in the favored and allowed regions and the number of outliers. The models were then
visualized by LiteMol viewer.
were then compared with the structure of BbZIP. In BbZIP,
Zn2+ is coordinated by Glu181, Gln207, and Glu211 and water
molecular at metal binding site as per our modeling (Figure 2;
Zhang et al., 2017). The Zn2+ binding site is also covered by
Glu276, His177, Met269, and Met99 which are involved in Zn
transport (Figure 2). However, the plant ZIP transporters showed
greater variation at Zn2+ binding site except for Glu181/211
(equivalent to BbZIP) based on the homology models (Figure 2
and Table 1). Zn2+ binding is coordinated by Glu141 and
Glu170 in ZmZIP6, Glu252 and Asp190 in ZmZIP11, Glu173
and Glu240 in OsZIP16, Glu253 and Asn30 in OsZIP13. Even
Zn2+ is co-ordinated only by a single Glu residue in AtZIP1
and AtZIP2 and not co-ordinated by any residues in AtZIP8
(Figure 2 and Table 1). The residues surrounding the Zn2+
binding site include Glu276, Met269, His177, and Met99 in
BbZIP. These residues are partially conserved in some plant
ZIPs and not at all conserved in other ZIPs modeled (Table 1).
For e.g., His177 is conserved in OsZIP6 (His169) and ZmZIP6
(His166); shifting in the positioning of His is seen in AtZIP1
(His238), AtZIP2 (His239), OsZIP13 (His249), and ZmZIP11
(His278) as indicated in the alignment above (Figures 1, 2 and
Table 1). Similar variation was seen for residues involved in
Zn transport in the plant ZIPs analyzed (Table 1). It might be
due to partially overlapping but distinct mechanism for binding
and transport of Zn2+ by plant ZIPs which is also reﬂected
in alignment (Supplementary Figure S1). This requires further
studies to conﬁrm the roles of functional residues especially
by site directed mutagenesis with yeast mutants to gain more
knowledge on residues involved in Zn2+ binding and transport
in plant ZIPs. Also, the high-resolution crystal structure of plant
ZIP is needed for understanding any speciﬁc Zn2+ transport
mechanism in plants.
Phylogenetic Analysis of Plant ZIP
Proteins
The phylogenetic tree was constructed from 113 ZIP protein
sequences collected from 14 plant species. These include eight
monocot plants and six dicot plants (Supplementary File S1).
The phylogenetic tree consisted of eight major clusters (MCs)
(MC1–MC8) and sub-divided into 1–2 sub-clusters (SCs) and
each SC was again divided into small clusters (Figure 3). More
ZIP transporters are clustered in MC-8. The MC-8 had 21 ZIP
transporters and it is followed by MC-5 (20 ZIPs) and MC-2
(18 ZIPs). The ZIP proteins of Brassica rapa (BrZIP1), Cucumis
sativus (CsZIP1), Medicago truncatula (MtZIP1), and Glycine
max (GmZIP1) were clustered with AtZIP1; BrZIP3 is closely
clustered with AtZIP3 (Figure 3). The AtZIP1 and AtZIP3
proteins are clustered closely which are characterized as low-
aﬃnity transporters (Grotz et al., 1998). In Arabidopsis, AtZIP1,
and AtZIP3 are highly expressed in roots in response to Zn
deﬁciency condition suggesting their role in Zn uptake from soil
(Grotz et al., 1998). OsZIP1 and OsZIP3 are characterized as low-
aﬃnity Zn transporters in rice plants (Ramesh et al., 2003) and
these are placed distinctly in the phylogenetic tree. The OsZIP1
is clustered with monocot ZIP transporters such as TaZIP1,
Panicum hallii ZIP1 (PhZIP1) and SbZIP1. The expression
analysis showed the OsZIP1 gene is induced in roots under Zn

starvation (Ramesh et al., 2003). Similarly, the OsZIP3 is closely
clustered with HvZIP3, TaZIP3, BdZIP3, and SbZIP3. HvZIP3
was reported as a low-aﬃnity transporter of barely (Pedas et al.,
2009). Both OsZIP3 and HvZIP3 are highly expressed in both
shoot and root under Zn deﬁcient condition (Chen et al., 2008).
AtZIP2 is a high-aﬃnity transporter in Arabidopsis (Grotz et al.,
1998), it is closely clustered with BrZIP2, SlZIP2 MtZIP2, TaZIP1,
OsZIP1, PhZIP1, and SbZIP1 proteins. It is interesting to see that
both low-aﬃnity (OsZIP1) and high-aﬃnity (AtZIP2) ZIPs are
closely clustered. The monocot and dicot plant ZIPs are clustered
in separate clusters. ZIP family member are mostly clustered
together as per their numbers (Figure 3), for e.g., ZIP1s of
Arabidopsis, mustard, barrel clover, soybean and sweet orange are
closely clustered. The identiﬁcation and characterization of the
ZIP gene family are still lacking for many crops. More molecular
and functional genomic studies will aid for the characterization
of ZIP transporter in other plants in future.
REGULATION OF ZIP TRANSPORTERS
IN PLANTS
All living organisms need to maintain optimum concentrations
of nutrients including Zn to sustain cellular functions (Shaul
et al., 1999). Plants possess the homeostatic networks to maintain
Zn levels in a narrow concentration to avoid either deﬁciency
or toxicity. Zn homeostasis needs a complex network of
cellular functions such as Zn uptake, accumulation, traﬃcking,
sequestration, remobilization, and detoxiﬁcation (Clemens, 2001;
Krishna et al., 2017). ZIP transporters are regulated to provide
a suitable quantity of Zn into all cell types and at all stages of
development (Clemens, 2001). The Zn homeostasis equilibrium
was considered for external and internal requirements of
Zn (Claus and Chavarría-Krauser, 2012). Unfortunately, very
little information is available on the regulation of plant ZIP
transporters and mechanism of Zn homeostasis. Transport of
divalent metal ions like Zn2+ by diﬀerent transporters may pose
some diﬃculty for high resolution studies to understand the
role of plant ZIPs in Zn homeostasis. Expression levels of genes
are increased for some ZIP transporters under Zn deﬁciency
to facilitate the higher uptake of Zn from the soil. For e.g., in
barley, HvZIP3, HvZIP5, and HvZIP8 genes are highly induced in
roots and are involved in Zn uptake under Zn deﬁcient condition
(Pedas et al., 2009).
Till date plant’s sensing and transferring the signal of Zn
deﬁciency remains poorly understood. However, based on the
available data, some transcription factors (TFs) are found to
be essential for regulation of target genes and maintaining Zn
homeostasis. Two TFs identiﬁed in model plant Arabidopsis are
shown to be crucial in the adaptation response to Zn deﬁciency.
The basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) is a TF involved in the
regulation of many physiological processes including abiotic and
biotic stress responses (Corrêa et al., 2008). These TFs belong
to the F group of bZIP and showed histidine-rich motifs at
the basic N-terminal region (Nijhawan et al., 2008; Assunção
et al., 2010). bZIP TFs are also involved in the up-regulation of
ZIP transporters in Arabidopsis during Zn deﬁciency (Assunção
et al., 2013). The TFs bZIP19 and bZIP23 are considered to be
the essential regulators of candidate genes including ZIPs under
Zn deﬁciency. In plants, bZIP19 and bZIP23 proteins exist as
monomers under Zn suﬃcient condition. The Zn deﬁciency leads
to the activation (binding) of bZIP9 and bZIP23 (dimerization)
which induces the expression of ZIP genes. The bZIP19 and
bZIP23 dimer bind to 10bp Zn-deﬁciency responsive elements
(RTGTCGACAY) present in the promoter region of target genes
(Assunção et al., 2010; Lilay et al., 2018). The histidine-rich
motif is conserved among group F bZIP TFs (Jakoby et al., 2002;
Castro et al., 2017) and suggested to play key role as a Zn-
sensor (Assunção et al., 2013; Henriques et al., 2017). Totally,
33 bZIP19 genes are identiﬁed and characterized in cereal crops
using in silico approaches and histidine-rich motifs are found in
most of these bZIP19 TFs (Henriques et al., 2017).
In Arabidopsis, the TFs AtbZIP19 and AtbZIP23 induce
the expression of AtZIP4 gene under Zn deﬁciency (Assunção
et al., 2010). These TFs are also involved in the activation (up-
regulation) of a speciﬁc subset of genes such as AtZIP1, AtZIP2,
AtZIP4, AtZIP5, AtZIP9, AtZIP10, and AtZIP12 (Assunção et al.,
2010; Inaba et al., 2015; Lilay et al., 2018). Similarly, three
bZIP TFs such as bZIP1, bZIP2, and bZIP3 were identiﬁed in
common bean which are similar to Arabidopsis TFs bZIP19,
bZIP23, and bZIP24 (Astudillo et al., 2013). In whole-genome
transcriptome analysis, 3 bZIP TFs (PvbZIP1, PvbZIP2, and
PvbZIP3) are found to be expressed under Zn deﬁciency
condition in common bean (Astudillo-Reyes et al., 2015). But

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
FIGURE 3 | Phylogenetic tree of ZIP transporter family proteins of plants. The ZIP phylogenetic tree was constructed from 113 ZIP transporter protein sequences
collected from 14 plant species. These included 8 monocot (Blue) and 6 dicot plants (Black). Each major cluster (MC1-MC8) is highlighted with different color. The
low-afﬁnity and high-afﬁnity ZIP transporters are highlighted in red and green, respectively. The protein sequences of ZIP transporter family members were collected
from Phytozome (www.phytozome.net) website. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA version 6 software with the maximum likelihood method based on
the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix-based model. The bootstrap values are from 1000 replicates. The phylogeny tree was visualized by iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/).
no information is available on target genes of these TFs.
Similarly, seven bZIP TFs were identiﬁed in the wheat
genome. Seven out of four TabZIP TFs such as TabZIPF1-
7DL, TabZIPF3b-7BL, TabZIPF4-7AL, and TabZIPF4-7DL of
wheat were used for functional complementation assay (Evens
et al., 2017). The role of these four TabZIP TFs in the Zn
homeostatic mechanism was determined by expression in the
Arabidopsis double mutant line bzip19-4 bzip23-2 under Zn
deﬁcient condition. The TabZIPF1-7DL and TabZIPF4-7AL
could partially complement the double mutant line (bzip19-4
bzip23-2) under Zn-deﬁcient condition. TabZIPF3b-7BL have
slightly increased the growth of the double mutant line
under Zn-deﬁcient condition whereas TabZIPF4-7DL did not
complement the double mutant lines (Evens et al., 2017).
Similarly, seven bZIP TFs HvbZIP1, HvbZIP10, HvbZIP55,
HvbZIP56, HvbZIP57, HvbZIP58, and HvbZIP62 were identiﬁed

in barely (Nazri et al., 2017). Among these, the TFs HvbZIP56
and HvbZIP62 could restore the growth of bzip19 and bzip23
double mutant of Arabidopsis under Zn deﬁciency condition
(Nazri et al., 2017). Recently, Lilay et al. (2020) identiﬁed
and characterized three bZIP TFs in rice such as OsbZIP48,
OsbZIP49, and OsbZIP50. The OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50
complemented the Arabidopsis double mutant (bzip19/bzip23)
under Zn deﬁcient condition but the OsbZIP49 does not
compliment the Arabidopsis double mutant (bzip19/bzip23)
(Lilay et al., 2020).
In plants, concentrations of both the macro- and micro-
nutrients inﬂuence each other through molecular cross-talks.
Signals of P nutrition interact with those of the micronutrients
like Zn and Fe. The TFs such as phosphate starvation response
1 (PHR1) (Rubio et al., 2001), ZAT6 (Devaiah et al., 2007b),
WRKY75 (Devaiah et al., 2007a), and MYB62 (Devaiah et al.,
2009) are involved in P deﬁciency response. The PHR1 acts
as a positive regulator of inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation
responsive genes and PHR1 along with Phosphate 1 (PHO1) are
involved in Zn and Fe homeostasis in Arabidopsis (Khan et al.,
2014; Rai et al., 2015). Zn deﬁciency also induced the expression
of P stress-responsive genes through PHR1 and increased the
uptake of Pi (Bouain et al., 2014). PHR1 seems to be a positive
regulator of the ZIP transporters (AtZIP2 and AtZIP4) under Pi
deﬁciency in Arabidopsis (Briat et al., 2015). The cross-talk of
signals between P, Zn, and Fe were highlighted by many articles
(Briat et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2019). Only a very little research
is done on the characterization Zn responsive and ZIP related
TFs in crops and most of the reports are also conﬁned only
to plants like Arabidopsis. Therefore, more studies are needed
on the identiﬁcation and characterization of Zn responsive
TFs in crops. This could help to understand the molecular
mechanism of Zn deﬁciency tolerance and may aid in developing
Zn deﬁciency tolerant crops.
ZIP FAMILY TRANSPORTERS
IDENTIFIED IN VARIOUS CROPS
We have enlisted the ZIP family members identiﬁed so far in
crops (Supplementary Table S1), and the details are discussed
below. ZIP family transporter genes have been identiﬁed and
functions characterized majorly in model plants like Arabidopsis
and rice. Identiﬁcation and characterization of the ZIP family
genes are still lacking for many crops. Expression levels of ZIP
family genes showed dynamic pattern in crops. For e.g., a few ZIP
transporters are expressed only under deplete Zn conditions, so
their expression is declined within 2 h when Zn is added to the
medium (Van de Mortel et al., 2006). The ZIP transporters are
localized to plasma membrane and membranes of many intra-
cellular organelles (Figure 4). It is proved that the plant ZIP
transporters are involved in Zn uptake at the cellular level when
tested in yeast complementation test (Fu et al., 2017). In model
plant Arabidopsis, the ZIP transporters such as AtZIP1, AtZIP2,
AtZIP3, and AtZIP4 have been functionally characterized to be
the transporters with diﬀerent aﬃnities (Grotz et al., 1998; Mäser
et al., 2001; Assunção et al., 2010). Evidence also shows the direct
involvement of ZIP transporter in enhancing Zn accumulation at
edible parts of the plants (Ramegowda et al., 2013; Gaitán-Solís
et al., 2015). Rice has been the only cereal model crop whose
ZIP family transporters have been studied to a reasonable extend
when compared to other crops. So, the details on rice ZIP and IRT
transporters are discussed in detail in the following section which
could serve as a model to study the ZIP and IRT transporters of
other crops especially cereals. We also discussed the details on
ZIP family transporters identiﬁed in other crops.
Rice
Rice is a staple food for more than 560 million people in the
world; it is one of the highly sensitive crops to Zn deﬁciency
(Krithika and Balachandar, 2016). Many works were conducted
on rice to understand the Zn transport mechanism and rice
seems to be a good model for other crops to study the Zn
transport. Totally 16 ZIP transporter members were identiﬁed
in rice (Ramesh et al., 2003; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Chen et al.,
2008). Some OsZIP genes are expressed in both roots and shoots
and others are expressed in whole parts of the plant such as
root, culms, leaves, and spikelets under Zn deﬁciency as reported
by diﬀerent authors (Figure 5A). In rice, several ZIPs such as
OsZIP1, OsZIP3, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP7, and OsZIP8 were
reported to be responsible for Zn uptake from soil, translocation
from root to shoot as well as for grain ﬁlling (Ramesh et al., 2003;
Ishimaru et al., 2005, 2007; Lee et al., 2010b; Meng et al., 2018). In
rice, understanding the molecular mechanisms of Zn transport
is important for improving the Zn content in the edible part.
Ishimaru et al. (2011) highlighted the mechanism of Zn uptake
and translocation in rice. The OsZIP1 and OsZIP3 seem to be
important for Zn uptake from the soil, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, and
OsZIP8 for root to shoot translocation, while OsZIP4 and OsZIP8
played a role in grain ﬁlling (Bashir et al., 2012). The expression
levels of OsZIP3 and OsZIP4 are higher in the roots of Zn-eﬃcient
genotype (IR8192) than those of in-eﬃcient genotype (Erjiufeng)
suggesting that these genes could contribute to high Zn eﬃciency
(Chen et al., 2008).
Under Zn deﬁcient condition, OsZIP1, OsZIP3, and OsZIP4
are up-regulated in the roots and OsZIP4 over-expressed in the
shoot of both genotypes (Chen et al., 2008). These transporters
are localized to the vascular bundles in shoots and in the vascular
bundles and epidermal cells in roots of rice (Ramesh et al.,
2003; Ishimaru et al., 2006). The expression analysis shows that
OsZIP4 is highly expressed under Zn deﬁcient conditions in
roots and shoots in rice (Ishimaru et al., 2005). It is expressed
in the meristem of the roots and shoots, and also in vascular
bundles of the roots and shoots under Zn deﬁcient condition
(Ishimaru et al., 2005; Ishimaru et al., 2011). The expression of
OsZIP1 gene is seen only in root tissues under Zn starvation,
but OsZIP3 is expressed in both roots and shoots under both Zn
suﬃcient and deﬁcient conditions (Ramesh et al., 2003). OsZIP7
and OsZIP8 are expressed in roots and shoots under Zn deﬁcient
condition (Yang et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2019). The OsZIP3 and
OsZIP4 are highly expressed in the nodal regions under Zn
deﬁciency condition (Sasaki et al., 2015). OsZIP1 is expressed
in the epidermis and vascular tissues of roots and leaves of rice
(Ramesh et al., 2003; Bashir et al., 2012). The OsZIP4, OsZIP5,

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
FIGURE 4 | Localization of ZIP transporter family proteins in the plant cell. The ZIP transporter family proteins are actively involved in uptake, transport, detoxiﬁcation
and homeostasis of Zn within plant cells (Li et al., 2013). Under low Zn condition, many ZIP transporters (ZIP1-ZIP12) are expressed and are localized in plasma
membrane of the cell in rice, (Ramesh et al., 2003; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2010a,b) hardy orange (Fu et al., 2017), maize (Li et al., 2013;
Mondal et al., 2013), Arabidopsis (Milner et al., 2013), and barley (Pedas et al., 2009; Tiong et al., 2015). Some of the ZIP transporters are also localized to the
membranes of intracellular organelles such as chloroplast [ZmZIP5 and ZmZIP7 (Li et al., 2013)], vacuole [HvZIP5 (Tiong et al., 2015) and AtZIP1 (Milner et al.,
2013)], and endoplasmic reticulum [ZmZIP1-ZmZIP8 (Li et al., 2013)].
and OsZIP8 transporters are localized to plasma membrane and
are involved in Zn inﬂux (Ishimaru et al., 2005; Lee et al.,
2010a,b). The OsZIP3 gene was expressed in the nodal region
which is responsible for unloading Zn from the xylem (Sasaki
et al., 2015). OsZIP7 is located in the parenchyma cells of vascular
bundles in nodal region, and in the stele in the roots of rice (Tan
et al., 2019). OsZIPs might be actively involved in the uptake
and transport of Zn in rice. Similarly, Ishimaru et al. (2011)
suggest that OsZIP4 may be responsible for Zn translocation
to aerial parts.
The OsIRTs are similar to OsZIP metal transporters; these
are the members of ZIP family transporters (Guerinot, 2000).
Especially OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 showed
sequence similarity to OsIRT1 (Ishimaru et al., 2005). The
expression analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are mainly
expressed in roots of rice under low Fe conditions (Bughio et al.,
2002; Ishimaru et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009). The expression
level OsIRT1 was much higher than OsIRT2 in the Fe deﬁcient
root of rice (Ishimaru et al., 2006). OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 have
been cloned and characterized in yeast (Bughio et al., 2002;
Ishimaru et al., 2006). The OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 proteins
localize to the plasma membrane and have been shown to
complement the growth defect of a yeast Fe uptake mutant,
conﬁrming that they are functional Fe2+ transporters under low
Fe condition (Bughio et al., 2002; Ishimaru et al., 2006). The
OsIRT transporters also capable of transporting other divalent
metal cations such as Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ (Bughio
et al., 2002; Nakanishi et al., 2006). Cellular and sub-cellular
metal homeostasis is very crucial for maintaining the optimal
metabolic process and cellular functioning (Bashir et al., 2016).
Therefore, identiﬁcation and characterization of IRT transporters
are essential for understanding the mechanism of Fe homeostasis
in rice and other plants.
The information available on Zn transporters of rice plants
are high when compared to other crops such as maize, wheat,
barley, foxtail millet, orange, and common bean, etc. This large
information is helpful for understanding the expression pattern
of Zn transporters, their localization and metal homeostasis in
other crops. Apart from these reports we need further studies
on the biofortiﬁcation of rice with Zn in order to increase the

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
FIGURE 5 | Expression of ZIP transporter genes in different parts of rice (A), maize (B), and wheat (C). The ZIP transporters are expressed in root, nodes, clumps,
shoot/stem, leaf, ﬂag leaf, kernel, and spikelets under Zn deﬁcient levels. Under low Zn condition, root tissues show the expression of ZIP genes in rice (Ramesh
et al., 2003; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2012), maize (Li et al., 2013; Mondal et al., 2013) and wheat (Durmaz et al.,
2011; Evens et al., 2017; Deshpande et al., 2018), clumps in rice (Yang et al., 2009), shoot/stem in rice (Ramesh et al., 2003; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Chen et al.,
2008; Yang et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2012), maize (Li et al., 2013; Mondal et al., 2013), and wheat (Durmaz et al., 2011; Evens et al., 2017). Leaf tissue also
showed the over expression of ZIP genes under low Zn soil in rice (Ramesh et al., 2003; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008) and wheat (Evens et al., 2017;
Deshpande et al., 2018), ﬂag leaf tissues in maize (Mondal et al., 2013) and wheat (Deshpande et al., 2018), kernel tissue in maize (Li et al., 2013) and spikelets

yield and quality of rice as it helps to improve the nutritional
status of humans.
Maize
Maize is one of the most widely cultivated and important cereal
crops for human and animal food (Shiferaw et al., 2011). Zn is the
most common limiting micronutrient in maize yield worldwide
(Alloway, 2009). The maize genome has been sequenced and
assembled (Palmer et al., 2003). Li et al. (2013) identiﬁed eight
ZIP transporters (ZmZIP1–ZmZIP8) in maize genome. All eight
ZmZIP proteins are localized to the plasma membrane (Li
et al., 2013). The expression analysis indicated that ZmZIP3,
ZmZIP4, ZmZIP5, ZmZIP7, and ZmZIP8 are sensitive to Zn
status during the seedlings stage of maize (Li et al., 2013). Under
Zn deﬁcient condition, ZmZIP5 and ZmZIP8 are induced in
shoot and ZmZIP3 is up-regulated in both root and shoot (Li
et al., 2013). The expression of ZmZIP4, ZmZIP5, ZmZIP7, and
ZmZIP8 decreased in shoots and ZmZIP3 is down-regulated in
roots of maize under excess Zn supply (Li et al., 2013). Similarly,
12 ZmZIP genes (ZmZIP1–ZmZIP12) were identiﬁed by Mondal
et al. (2013) in maize. Ten ZmZIP genes (ZmZIP1, ZmZIP2, and
ZmZIP4–ZmZIP11) are tissue-speciﬁc and are highly expressed
in ﬂag leaf except ZmZIP3 and ZmZIP12, under Zn deﬁcient
condition (Mondal et al., 2013). The ZmZIP2, ZmZIP5, ZmZIP6,
ZmZIP8, and ZmZIP11 are expressed in the kernel under Zn
deﬁcient condition (Mondal et al., 2013). ZmZIP4, ZmZIP5,
ZmZIP7, and ZmZIP9 proteins are located in cytoplasm and
chloroplast (Mondal et al., 2013; Figure 4). It is well known that
some ZIP transporters are involved in Zn biofortiﬁcation in other
crops. For example, the OsZIP4 and OsZIP8 are actively involved
in the grain ﬁlling of Zn in rice (Ishimaru et al., 2007; Lee et al.,
2010b). The ZmZIP5 and ZmZIP11 are highly expressed in the
ﬂag leaf, which might play a vital role in the mobilization of Zn
from ﬂag leaf to developing kernel for the accumulation of the
large amount of Zn in the kernel (Mondal et al., 2013; Figure 5B).
These ZmZIPs (ZmZIP5 and ZmZIP11) might contribute to the
biofortiﬁcation of maize with Zn to improve the quality (Mondal
et al., 2013). Since maize is highly sensitive to Zn deﬁciency, more
high resolution studies are needed to improve the quality of maize
grown under low Zn soils.
Wheat
Wheat is a major cereal crop for whole world and it provides
about one-half of humans’ food calories and a large part of
their nutrient requirements (Shiferaw et al., 2013). Complete
assembly of the hexaploid bread wheat genome is available now
(Zimin et al., 2017). Previously, very little was known about ZIP
family transporters except for TdZIP1 from wild emmer wheat
(Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides), a Zn transporter with higher
expression under Zn deﬁciency (Durmaz et al., 2011). Recently,
14 TaZIP genes were identiﬁed in bread wheat (Triticum
aestivum) (Evens et al., 2017). Out of 14 ZIPs, ﬁve (TaZIP3,
TaZIP5, TaZIP6, TaZIP7, and TaZIP13) were analyzed for the
expression level in shoot and root under Zn starvation. In shoot,
expression of all ﬁve TaZIPs increased under low Zn conditions
but the timing varied between individual genes. In roots, TaZIP3,
TaZIP5, TaZIP7, and TaZIP13 showed increased expression
under Zn starvation with expression of only TaZIP6 gene remains
fairly stable (Evens et al., 2017). Similarly, Deshpande et al. (2018)
analyzed the relative expression of ﬁve selective ZIP genes in
durum wheat (Triticum durum) genotypes UC 1114 and MACS
3125 under three diﬀerent foliar application of Zn (Deshpande
et al., 2018). In ﬂag leaves, expression level of three TdZIP
genes (TdZIP1, TdZIP3, and TdZIP7) decreased and two genes

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
(TdZIP10 and TdZIP15) increased during grain development
(Deshpande et al., 2018). Time-dependent expression patterns
of these ZIP transporters revealed that the expression pattern
varies with tissues viz., ﬂag leaves, non-ﬂag leaves, stem, and spike
(Deshpande et al., 2018). These studies revealed that most of
the TaZIP transporter genes are expressed in all parts and are
involved in Zn uptake and translocation under Zn starvation
(Figure 5C). Till now, totally 16 ZIP genes are identiﬁed in the
wheat genome and only a few works have been carried out on the
expression analysis with these when compared to rice. No reports
are available on localization and functional characterization of
TaZIP transporters which may help to understand further on the
Zn transport mechanism.
Barley
Barley is a nutritionally and economically important cereal crop.
Till date, only a few ZIP family genes have been identiﬁed
and characterized in barely. Pedas et al. (2009) reported that
HvZIP3, HvZIP5, and HvZIP8 are induced in root tissues under
Zn deﬁcient condition. These three HvZIP transporters might
be involved in Zn uptake under low Zn conditions. HvZIP7
is highly induced in the vascular tissues of roots and leaves
under Zn deﬁciency condition and its protein is localized to
plasma membrane (Tiong et al., 2014). In another report, 13
HvZIP genes were identiﬁed and their tissue-speciﬁc expression
was also determined under Zn deﬁciency condition. Out of 13
HvZIP genes, six (HvZIP3, HvZIP5, HvZIP7, HvZIP8, HvZIP10,
and HvZIP13) were highly induced in Zn deﬁcient barely (Tiong
et al., 2015). The expression levels of these six HvZIP genes
are signiﬁcantly increased (3-fold) in roots under Zn deﬁcient
condition (0.005 µM Zn) compared to Zn suﬃcient condition
(0.5 µM Zn) (Tiong et al., 2015). All the six HvZIP proteins are
localized to plasma membrane (Tiong et al., 2015). The HvZIP2,
HvZIP3, HvZIP5, HvZIP7, HvZIP8, HvZIP10, and HvZIP13 are
also induced in shoot of barley under Zn deﬁcient condition.
Recently, ﬁve HvZIP family genes such as HvZIP3, HvZIP7,
HvZIP8, HvZIP9, and HvZIP13 were screened for their expression
under the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) medium with low
and high Zn treatments (Watts-Williams and Cavagnaro, 2018).
Under low Zn condition, the HvZIP genes were up-regulated in
the root of barley in the non-AMF condition. But, the activity
of AMF has altered the expression of HvZIP family genes. The
HvZIP13 gene was signiﬁcantly overexpressed in the mycorrhizal
plant than non-mycorrhizal plants under low Zn condition.
Two HvZIP genes (HvZIP3 and HvZIP8) are down-regulated in
mycorrhizal roots at low Zn soil (Watts-Williams and Cavagnaro,
2018). Therefore, ZIP genes may be directly or indirectly involved
in the transport of Zn between the AMF and plant under low Zn
conditions. Apart from this, no other information is available on
the eﬀect of AMF on the ZIP gene expression in other crops. AMF
has the ability to improve the nutrition of the host plant through
increased uptake of soil nutrients, especially immobile nutrients
such as P, K, Zn, Fe, and Cu (Pellegrino and Bedini, 2014;
Pellegrino et al., 2015; Watts-Williams and Cavagnaro, 2018).
Kaiser et al. (2015) reported that the AMF (Glomus contrictus or
Glomus fasciculatus) enhances the Zn up-take in barely. Further
studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanism of
AMF-mediated Zn transport and signals and TFs involved in this
symbiotic Zn uptake.
Foxtail Millet
Foxtail millet is one of the food security minor cereal crops in
low input regions. It is a domesticated diploid C4 crop having a
small genome (∼515 Mb) with short life cycle (Doust et al., 2009).
So, it is considered as a model crop for genetic and genomic
studies of monocots (Lata et al., 2013; Ceasar et al., 2014). The
whole-genome sequence is available for two diﬀerent genotypes
of foxtail millet (Bennetzen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). But,
the information about ZIP genes is limited. Alagarasan et al.
(2017) identiﬁed seven SiZIP genes (SiZIP1–SiZIP7) in foxtail
millet. The expression pattern of seven SiZIP genes was analyzed
in root, leaf, stem and spica tissues of foxtail millet grown under
drought stress without any additional nutrient supplementation.
All seven SiZIP genes were induced in all four tissues (root, leaf,
stem, and spica) with various levels of expression. The SiZIP2,
SiZIP3, SiZIP4, and SiZIP5 showed relatively higher expression
and low level of expression was observed with SiZIP6, in all
tissues. SiZIP1 gene is moderately expressed in root, shoot and
spica and very least expression was seen in leaf (Alagarasan et al.,
2017). The highly induced SiZIP genes (SiZIP2, SiZIP3, SiZIP4,
and SiZIP5) could be used for the bio-fortiﬁcation process for the
enrichment of Zn into the seeds of foxtail millet. The functional
characterization of ZIP genes in foxtail millet could aid to
improve the Zn uptake in foxtail millet and other minor millets.
Orange
Orange is an important fruit crop with 60 million metric tonnes
of annual production worldwide and has high nutritional values,
vitamins and other nutrients (Etebu and Nwauzoma, 2014). Till
date, orange is the only fruit crop in which ZIP transporters
are identiﬁed. In navel orange (Citrus sinensis), four ZIP genes
such as CsZIP1, CsZIP2, CsZIP3, and CsZIP4 were identiﬁed
and expression analysis show that CsZIP3 and CsZIP4 are highly
expressed in mild, moderate and severely aﬀected Zn deﬁcient
leaf. CsZIP1 gene is down-regulated under mild Zn deﬁcient
leaf and up-regulated in moderate and severely Zn depleted leaf.
There is no change in the expression of CsZIP2 in all tissues
when compared with control (Fei et al., 2016). Recently, 13 ZIP
(PtZIP1–PtZIP3 and PtZIP5–PtZIP14) genes were identiﬁed in
trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata), another variety of orange
fruit crop. PtZIP1, PtZIP2, PtZIP3, PtZIP5, PtZIP6, and PtZIP9
are highly induced in roots, whereas PtZIP1, PtZIP2, PtZIP5,
PtZIP6, and PtZIP7 are highly expressed in leaves, under
Zn-deﬁcient condition (Fu et al., 2017). In future, functional
characterization of ZIP genes in orange is very important to
improve the Zn content in the edible parts of orange. Therefore,
it will help to reduce the Zn deﬁciency problems in humans. So,
more studies are needed to improve the quality of orange in terms
of biofortiﬁcation.
Common Bean
Common bean is an important food crop for human as it
contains a rich source of nutrients (Gepts et al., 2008), especially
a source of dietary Zn (Astudillo-Reyes et al., 2015). Totally 19

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
PvZIP genes (PvZIP1–PvZIP19) were identiﬁed in common bean.
But, only seven PvZIP genes such as PvZIP2, PvZIP6, PvZIP7,
PvZIP12, PvZIP13, PvZIP16, and PvZIP18 were analyzed for their
expression dynamics. The selection of PvZIP genes is based on
their location in the genome relative to the presence of QTLs for
seed Zn content (Astudillo et al., 2013). PvZIP12, PvZIP13, and
PvZIP16 genes are expressed in root, leaf and pod of the common
bean under Zn deﬁcient condition (Astudillo et al., 2013). Other
PvZIP genes are not expressed in any tissue types in Zn deﬁcient
condition. The PvZIP12 is highly expressed in leaves at vegetative
stage and PvZIP13 is highly expressed in leaves at ﬂowering stage.
Hence, the PvZIP12 gene could be involved in mobilizing the
Zn to seeds of bean. The identiﬁcation and characterization of
the candidate genes related to PvZIP transporters may help to
improve Zn uptake and nutrient content of seeds.
FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF
ZIP TRANSPORTERS IN CROPS
Till date, only a little information is available on functional
characterization of ZIP transporters in crops (Milner et al.,
2013). Mostly, the investigations on the functions of plant ZIP
transporters have been conducted by yeast complementation
assays which revealed that ZIP transporters are capable of
transporting various divalent cations (Guerinot, 2000). For
functional characterization, Zn sensitive yeast mutant (zrt1/zrt2)
which is defective in both the ZRT1 high−aﬃnity and the
ZRT2 low−aﬃnity uptake transporters and is susceptible to Zn
deﬁcient conditions, was employed (Zhao and Eide, 1996a,b).
In most of these studies, genes of model plant A. thaliana are
used. The AtZIP genes such as AtZIP1, AtZIP2, and AtZIP3

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
enabled Zn transport based on the yeast complementation assay
(Eide, 1998; Grotz et al., 1998; Guerinot, 2000). In another
study, six ZIP genes such as AtZIP1, AtZIP2, AtZIP3, AtZIP7,
AtZIP11, and AtZIP12, are able to complement the zrt1/zrt21
yeast mutant fully or partially under Zn deﬁcient conditions
(Milner et al., 2013). Recently, Fu et al. (2017) characterized the
Zn transport speciﬁcities of the PtZIP genes and PtZIP1, PtZIP2,
PtZIP3, and PtZIP12 are also able to complement zrt1zrt2 mutant
(Fu et al., 2017).
In plants, the high-aﬃnity ZIP transporter system was
highly active under low Zn conditions. Based on a yeast
complementation
assay,
the
aﬃnity
values
of
AtZIP1
(Km = 13 µM) and AtZIP3 (Km = 14 µM) conﬁrmed to
be low-aﬃnity transporters and AtZIP2 (Km = 2 µM) as
high-aﬃnity transporter (Grotz et al., 1998). In rice, OsZIP1
(Km = 16.3 µM) and OsZIP3 (Km = 18.5 µM) are characterized as
low-aﬃnity Zn transporters (Ramesh et al., 2003). The GmZIP1
of soybean was identiﬁed to be a low-aﬃnity transporter
(Km = 13.8 µM) (Moreau et al., 2002). The high aﬃnity
transporters ZmZIP3, ZmZIP4, ZmZIP5, ZmZIP7, and ZmZIP8
were identiﬁed in maize (Li et al., 2013; Mondal et al., 2013).
Similarly, Pedas et al. (2009) found that HvZIP3 and HvZIP8
are low-aﬃnity transporters and HvZIP5 is a high-aﬃnity Zn
transporter in barely based on yeast complementation assay.
However, additional kinetic assay is essential for conﬁrming
this hypothesis. Till now, very little information is available on
the aﬃnities of ZIP transporters in crops (Table 2). Further,
heterologous expression of plant ZIP transporters in yeast may
not replicate the same function and may yield false results due
to being a completely diﬀerent system and lack of key signals
involved in the regulation of Zn concentration. Testing the
function of plant ZIPs in the same plant by knock-out studies
may yield conﬁdent results. To this end, newly adopted genome
editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 may help for the eﬃcient generation
of single, double and multiple mutants for plant ZIPs to test
their function in the same system. Characterization of other ZIP
transporters could help to understand the crucial roles of ZIP
transporter family genes in crops.
MANIPULATION OF EXPRESSION
LEVELS OF ZIP GENES THROUGH
TRANSGENIC MODIFICATION
The plant ZIP genes were over expressed through transgenic
modiﬁcation in some studies. Till now, only a few genes such
as AtZIP1, OsZIP1, ZmZIP3, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, and HvZIP7
were used for over-expression analysis in crops (Table 3). For
example, OsZIP1 gene was transferred into ﬁnger millet using
pGreen0179 vector under the control of Bx17 promoter through
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation; the transgenic plants
showed signiﬁcantly improved accumulation of Zn in seeds
(Ramegowda et al., 2013). Similarly, over-expression of AtZIP1
gene in cassava showed an increase of 25% Zn content in the
edible part of the plant (Gaitán-Solís et al., 2015). Over expression
of OsZIP4, OsZIP5, and OsZIP8 in transgenic rice decreased
the Zn content in shoot and seed; but signiﬁcantly increased
the root Zn content (Ishimaru et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010a,b).
It clearly revealed that these OsZIP transporters play a crucial
role in Zn uptake from the soil. Over-expression of OsZIP4
in rice plants showed the reduction of plant growth under Zn
deﬁcient conditions (Ishimaru et al., 2007). Approximately, 50%
reduction observed in plant height and root length in OsZIP4
over-expressing transgenic rice plants (Ishimaru et al., 2007).
At the ﬂowering stage, OsZIP5 and OsZIP8 over-expressing
transgenic rice plants are shorter and had fewer tillers (Lee
et al., 2010a,b). Also, these transgenic plants produce very fewer
grains (Lee et al., 2010a,b). Similarly, over-expression of OsIRT1
in rice altered the plant architecture and increased the Fe and
Zn contents in mature seeds and vegetative parts of the plant
under Zn deﬁcient condition (Lee and An, 2009). These studies
indicate that the ZIP transporters are responsible for improving

Plant ZIP Family Transporters
the nutritional quality in crops. So, more eﬀort is needed to
identify the speciﬁc function of all ZIP genes in crops and it could
help to develop transgenic plants related to biofortiﬁcation of
edible parts with Zn/Fe in crops.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PROSPECTS
Zinc is not only essential for plant growth but also crucial for
human health. It is estimated that nearly 50% of the world’s
population is at the risk of Zn deﬁciency problems (Pedas and
Husted, 2009). In humans, Zn deﬁciency impairs growth and
development, aﬀects the nervous system, reduces immunity and
can cause death (Ekweagwu et al., 2008; Menguer et al., 2018).
Researchers need to pay more attention to the biofortiﬁcation of
food crops with priority to Zn. The ZIP transporters play a crucial
role in biofortiﬁcation with Zn. In soil, Zn deﬁciency problem
is usually tackled by adding Zn containing fertilizers. But, it is
only a temporary solution. Also, the subsistence farmers cannot
aﬀord to buy Zn fertilizers all the time due to high market price.
Identiﬁcation of candidate genes related to ZIP transporters, their
characterization and tapping this information to develop crops
via transgenic and/or the marker-assisted selection may help
for developing Zn eﬃcient crops. Genetic modiﬁcation of crops
with ZIP genes is also helpful in improving the crops related
to Zn use eﬃciency. Therefore, the structural and functional
insight of plant ZIP transporter are essential. The bioinformatics
study showed that the plant ZIP transporters may have partially
overlapping but distinct metal transport mechanism compared
to BbZIP as some of the residues involved in metal binding
and transport are not conserved in plant ZIPs. The plant ZIP
transporters showed greater variation at the Zn2+ binding site
when compared to BbZIP. The phylogenetic analysis of 113 plant
ZIP proteins from 14 plant species revealed that the ZIP family
members are mainly clustered together as per their numbers.
Monocot and dicot plant ZIPs are clustered in separate clusters
and both low-aﬃnity and high-aﬃnity ZIPs are closely clustered.
These ﬁndings would be a valuable theoretical knowledge for
future studies in terms of understanding the gene, protein,
functional residues of Zn transporters in crops and might be
helpful to overcome the problems associated with Zn deﬁciency.
Many ZIP family genes involved in Zn transport have been
characterized in model plants. Identiﬁcation and functional
characterization of certain ZIP genes, their relative expression
and localization have been done only in a few crops such as rice
and maize. More information on Zn transporters are available for
rice plants when compared to other crops so this can serve as a
model to study Zn transport in other cereal crops. ZIP family
members involved in Zn transport and sequestration represent
some of the clearest candidate genes for increased Zn content
in crops. But very little information is available on how Zn
is transported from leaf xylem to phloem of developing seeds
and ultimately unloaded into seeds with the help of ZIP genes.
This needs further research in the coming years. Identiﬁcation
and characterization of ZIP proteins and related TFs in many
crops would help for the better understanding of Zn homeostasis.
A more holistic and high-resolution studies on ZIP transporters
in crops will help to overcome the problems associated with low
Zn soils and to improve the human health.
