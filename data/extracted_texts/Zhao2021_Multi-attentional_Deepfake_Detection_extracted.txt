Abstract
Face forgery by deepfake is widely spread over the in-
ternet and has raised severe societal concerns. Recently,
how to detect such forgery contents has become a hot re-
search topic and many deepfake detection methods have
been proposed.
Most of them model deepfake detection
as a vanilla binary classiﬁcation problem, i.e, ﬁrst use a
backbone network to extract a global feature and then feed
it into a binary classiﬁer (real/fake). But since the differ-
ence between the real and fake images in this task is often
subtle and local, we argue this vanilla solution is not op-
timal. In this paper, we instead formulate deepfake detec-
tion as a ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation problem and propose a
new multi-attentional deepfake detection network. Speciﬁ-
cally, it consists of three key components: 1) multiple spa-
tial attention heads to make the network attend to differ-
ent local parts; 2) textural feature enhancement block to
zoom in the subtle artifacts in shallow features; 3) aggre-
gate the low-level textural feature and high-level semantic
features guided by the attention maps. Moreover, to address
the learning difﬁculty of this network, we further introduce
a new regional independence loss and an attention guided
data augmentation strategy. Through extensive experiments
on different datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our
method over the vanilla binary classiﬁer counterparts, and
achieve state-of-the-art performance. The models will be
released recently at https://github.com/yoctta/

1. Introduction
Beneﬁting from the great progress in generative mod-
els, deepfake techniques have achieved signiﬁcant success
recently and various face forgery methods [19, 41, 21, 31,
32, 44, 28, 38] have been proposed. As such techniques

can generate high-quality fake videos that are even indistin-
guishable for human eyes, they can easily be abused by ma-
licious users to cause severe societal problems or political
threats. To mitigate such risks,many deepfake detection ap-
proaches [27, 34, 22, 33, 26, 45] have been proposed. Most
of them model deepfake detection as a vanilla binary clas-
siﬁcation problem (real/fake). Basically, they often ﬁrst use
a backbone network to extract global features of the suspect
image and then feed them into a binary classiﬁer to discrim-
inate the real and fake ones.
However, as the counterfeits become more and more re-
alistic, the differences between real and fake ones will be-
come more subtle and local, thus making such global fea-
ture based vanilla solutions work not well. But actually,
such subtle and local property shares a similar spirit as the
ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation problem.
For example, in the
ﬁne-grained bird classiﬁcation task, some species look very
similar and only differentiate from each other by some small
and local differences, such as the shape and color of the
beak. Based on this observation, we propose to model deep-
fake detection as a special ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation prob-

lem with two categories.
Inspired by the success of parts based model in the
ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation ﬁeld, this paper presents a novel
multi-attention network for deepfake detection.
First, in
order to make the network attend to different potential ar-
tifacts regions, we design multi-attention heads to predict
multiple spatial attention maps by using the deep semantic
features. Second, to prevent the subtle difference from dis-
appearing in the deep layers, we enhance the textural feature
obtained from shallow layers and then aggregate both low-
level texture features and high-level semantic features as the
representation for each local part. Finally, the feature rep-
resentations of each local part will be independently pooled
by a bilinear attention pooling layer and fused as the repre-
sentation for the whole image. Figure 1 gives an example
of the discriminative features obtained by our method.
However, training such a multi-attentional network is not
a trivial problem. This is mainly because that, unlike single-
attentional network [6] which can use the video-level labels
as explicit guidance and be trained in a supervised way, the
multi-attentional structure can only be trained in an unsu-
pervised or weakly-supervised way. By using a common
learning strategy, we ﬁnd the multi-attention heads will de-
grade to a single-attention counterpart, i.e., only one atten-
tion region produces a strong response while all remaining
attention regions are suppressed and can not capture use-
ful information. To address this problem, we further pro-
pose a new attention guided data augmentation mechanism.
In detail, during training, we will deliberately blur some
high-response attention region (soft attention dropping)
and force the network to learn from other attention regions.
Simultaneously, we introduce a new regional independence
loss to encourage different attention heads to attend to dif-
ferent local parts.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-attentional
network, we conduct extensive experiments on different
existing datasets, including FaceForensics++[34], Celeb-
DF[25] and DFDC[9]. It shows that our method is superior
to the vanilla binary classiﬁer baselines and achieves state-
of-the-art performance. In summary, the contributions of
this paper are threefold as below:
• We reformulate the deepfake detection as a ﬁne-
grained classiﬁcation task, which brings a novel per-
spective for this ﬁeld.
• We propose a new multi-attentional network architec-
ture to capture local discriminative features from mul-
tiple face attentive regions. To train this network, we
also introduce a regional independence loss and design
an attention guided data augmentation mechanism to
assist the network training in an adversarial learning
way.
• Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the vanilla binary classiﬁcation baselines
and achieves state-of-the-art detection performance.
2. Related Works
Face forgery detection is a classical problem in computer
vision and graphics. Recently, the rapid progress in deep
generative models makes the face forgery technique “deep”
and can generate realistic results, which presents a new
problem of deepfake detection and brings signiﬁcant chal-
lenges. Most deepfake detection methods solve the problem
as a vanilla binary classiﬁcation, however, the subtle and lo-
cal modiﬁcations of forgeried faces make it more similar to
ﬁne-grained visual classiﬁcation problem.
2.1. Deepfake Detection
Since the face forgery causes great threat to societal se-
curity, it is of paramount importance to develop effective
countermeasures against it. Many works [46, 23, 4, 53, 34,
22, 33, 26, 45, 43] have been proposed. Early works [46, 23]
detect the forgery through visual biological artifacts, e.g.,
unnatural eye blinking or inconsistent head pose.
As the learning based methods become mainstream,
some works [53, 34] have proposed frameworks which ex-
tract features from spatial domain and have achieved ex-
cellent performances on speciﬁc datasets. Recently, more
data domains have been considered by emerging methods.
[45] detects tampered faces through Spatial, Steganalysis
and Temporal features. It adds a stream of simpliﬁed Xcep-
tion with a constrained convolution layer and an LSTM.
[26] uses a two-branch representation extractor to combine
information from the color domain and the frequency do-
main using a multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) op-
erator. [33] uses frequency-aware decomposition and local
frequency statistic to expose deepfake artifacts in frequency
domain and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Most existing methods treat the deepfake detection as a
universal binary classiﬁcation problem. They focus on how
to construct sophisticated feature extractors and then a di-
chotomy to distinguish the real and fake faces. However,
the photo-realistic counterfeits bring signiﬁcant challenge
to this binary classiﬁcation framework. In this paper, we
redeﬁne the deepfake detection problem as a ﬁne-grained
classiﬁcation problem according to their similarity.
2.2. Fine-grained Classiﬁcation
Fine-grained classiﬁcation [50, 49, 13, 37, 12, 52, 47, 17,
10] is a challenging research task in computer vision, which
captures the local discriminative features to distinguish dif-
ferent ﬁne-grained categories. Studies in this ﬁeld mainly
focus on locating the discriminative regions and learning
a diverse collection of complementary parts in weakly-
supervised manners.

models to localize objects and treat the objects and seman-
tic parts equally. Recently, several works [52, 47, 10] have
been proposed under a multiple attentional framework, the
core ideal of these method is that learning discriminative re-
gions in multiple scales or image parts simultaneously and
encouraging the fusion of these features from different re-
gions. In addition, [17] designs attention cropping and at-
tention dropping to obtain more balanced attention maps.
In this paper, we model deepfake detection as a special ﬁne-
grained classiﬁcation problem for the ﬁrst time. It shares the
same spirit in learning subtle and discriminative features,
but only involves two categories, i.e., real and fake.
3. Methods
3.1. Overview
In this section, we initially state the motivation of the
designing and give a brief overview of our framework.
As aforementioned, the discrepancy between real and fake
faces is usually subtle and occurs in local regions, which
is not easy to be captured by single-attentional structural
networks. Thus we argue that decomposing the attention
into multiple regions can be more efﬁcient for collecting
local feature for deepfake detection task. Meanwhile, the
global average pooling which is commonly adopted by cur-
rent deepfake detection approaches is replaced with local
attention pooling in our framework.
This is mainly be-
cause the textural patterns vary drastically among different
regions, the extracted features from different regions may
be averaged by the global pooling operation, resulting in
a loss of distinguishability. On the other hand, we observe
that the slight artifacts caused by forgery methods tend to be
preserved in textural information of shallow features. Here,
the textural information represents the high frequency com-
ponent of the shallow features, just like the residual infor-

mation of RGB images. Therefore, more shallow feature
should be focused on and enhanced, which has not been
considered by current state-of-the-art detection approaches.
Motivated by these observation, we propose a multi-
attentional framework to solve the deepfake detection as a
ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation problem. In our framework, three
key components are integrated into the backbone network:
1) We employ an attention module to generate multiple at-
tention maps. 2) We use densely connected convolutional
layers [18] as a texture enhancement block, which can ex-
tract and enhance the textural information from shallow fea-
ture maps. 3) We replace the global average pooling with
Bilinear Attention Pooling(BAP). And we use BAP to col-
lect the textural feature matrix from the shallow layer and
retain the semantic feature from the deep layer. The frame-
work of our method is depicted in Figure 2.
Unlike single-attentional structure based network which
can take the video-level labels as explicit guidance for train-
ing, the multi-attentional based network can only be trained
in a unsupervised or weakly-supervised manner due to the
lack of region-level labels.
It could lead to a degrada-
3

tion of network that multiple attention maps focus on same
region while ignoring other regions which may also pro-
vide discriminative information. To address the problem,
we speciﬁcally design a Region Independence Loss, which
aims to ensure each attention map focusing on one speciﬁc
region without overlapping and the focused region is con-
sistent across different samples. Further, we employ the At-
tention Guided Data Augementation(AGDA) mechanism to
decrease the salience of the most discriminative feature and
force other attention maps to mine more useful information.
3.2. Multi-attentional Framework
Denote the input face image of network as I and the
backbone network of our framework as f, the feature maps
extracted from the intermediate stage of t-th layer is de-
noted as ft(I) with size of Ct × Ht × Wt. Here, Ct is the
number of channels, Ht, Wt are the height and the width of
feature maps, respectively.
Multiple Attention Maps Generation.
As described
above, given a real/fake face image I as input, our frame-
work ﬁrst uses an attention block to generate multiple atten-
tion maps for I. As shown in Figure 3, the attention block
is a light weighted model which consists of a 1× 1 con-
volutional layer, a batch normalization layer and non-linear
activation layer ReLU. The feature map extracted from a
speciﬁc layer SLa will be fed into this attention block to
obtain M attention maps A with size of Ht × Wt, among
which Ak ∈R{Ht×Wt} represents the k-th attention map
and corresponds to one speciﬁc discriminative region, for
example, eyes, mouth or even blending boundary deﬁned in
[22]. The determination of SLa will be discussed in Sec-
tion 4.
Textural Feature Enhancement. Most binary classiﬁca-
tion frameworks of deepfake detection do not pay attention
to an important phenomenon, that is, the artifacts caused
by forgery methods are usually salient in the textural infor-
mation of shallow feature maps. The textural information
here represents the high frequency component of the shal-
low features. Thus to preserve more textural information
for capturing those artifacts, we design a textural feature
enhancement block as shown in Figure 3. We ﬁrst apply the
local average pooling in patches to down-sample the fea-
ture maps from a speciﬁc layer SLt and obtain the pooled
feature map D. How to choose SLt will be discussed in
the following experiments part. Then similar to the texture
representation of spatial image, we deﬁne the residual at the
feature level to represent the texture information as below:
TSLt = fSLt(I) −D
(1)
Here T contains most textural information of fSLt(I).
We then use a densely connected convolution block with
3 layers to enhance T, the output is noted as F
∈
RCF ×Hs×Ws, which is deﬁned as “textual feature map”.
Bilinear Attention Pooling. After getting the attention map
A and textural feature map F, we use Bilinear Attention
Pooling (BAP) to obtain feature maps. We bidirectionally
use BAP for both shallow feature maps and deep feature
maps. As shown in Figure 3, to extract shallow textural fea-
ture, we ﬁrst use bilinear interpolation to resize the attention
maps into the same scale with feature maps if they are not
match. Then, we respectively element-wise multiply tex-
tural feature map F by each attention map Ak and obtain
partial textural feature maps Fk.
To the end of this step, the partial textural feature maps
Fk should be fed into classiﬁer after global pooling. How-
ever, considering the differences among the different region
range, if using the traditional global average pooling, the
pooled feature vector will be inﬂuenced by the intensity of
attention map, which violates the purpose of focusing on
textural information. To address the problem, we design a
normalized average pooling:
vk =
PHs−1
m=0
PWs−1
n=0
Fk,m,n
|| PHs−1
m=0
PWs−1
n=0
Fk,m,n||2
(2)
The normalized attention features vk ∈R1×N are then
stacked together to obtain the textural feature matrix P ∈
RM×CF , which will be fed into the classiﬁer.
As to deep features, we ﬁrst splice each attention map to
get a single channel attention map Asum. Then we use BAP
for Asum and the feature map from the last layer of network
to get the global deep feature G, which will also be fed into
the classiﬁer.
3.3. Regional Independence Loss for Attention
Maps Regularization
As aforementioned, training a multiple attention network
may easily fall into a network degraded case due to the lack
of ﬁne-grained level labels. In details, different attention
maps tend to focus on the same region as shown in Figure 4
which is not conducive to the network to capture rich in-
formation for a given input. In addition, for different input
images, we hope that the each attention map locates in ﬁxed
semantic region, for example, attention map A1 focuses on
eyes in different image, A2 focuses on mouth. Therefore,
the randomness of captured information by each attention
map will be reduced.
To achieve these goals, we propose a Region Indepen-
dence Loss which helps to reduce the overlap among atten-
tion maps and keep the consistency for different inputs. We
apply BAP on the pooled feature map D otained in Sec-
tion 3.2 to get a “semantic feature vector” : V ∈RM×N,
and the Regional Independence Loss is deﬁned as below by
modifying the center loss in [15]:

and updated in each iteration:
ct = ct−1 −α

Here α is the updating rate of feature centers, we decay
α after each training epoch. The ﬁrst part of LRIL is an
intra-class loss that pulls V close to feature center c, the
second part is an inter-class loss that repels feature centers
scattered. we optimize c by calculating the gradient for V
in each batch. Considering that the patterns of texture in
fake faces should be more diverse than real ones for fakes
are generated by multiple methods, thus we restrict part fea-
tures of fake faces in the neighborhood from the feature cen-
ter of real ones but with larger margin. In this way, we give
a larger margin in the intra-class for searching useful infor-
mation in fake faces.
For the objective function of our framework, we combine
this Regional Independence Loss with the traditional cross
entropy loss:
L = λ1 ∗LCE + λ2 ∗LRIL
(5)
LCE is a cross entropy loss, λ1 and λ2 are the balancing
weights for these two terms. By default, we set λ1 = λ2 =
1 in our experiments.
3.4. Attention Guided Data Augmentations
Under the restraining of Regional Independence Loss,
we reduce the overlap of different attention regions. How-
ever, although different attention regions can be well sepa-
rated, the attention maps may still respond to the same dis-
criminative features. For example, in Figure 5, the attention
regions are not overlapped but they all strongly respond to
the landmarks of input faces. To force the different atten-
tion maps to focus on different information, we propose the
Attention Guided Data Augmentation (AGDA) mechanism.
For each training sample, one of the attention maps Ak is
randomly selected to guide the data augmentation process,
and it is normalized as Augmentation Map A∗
k ∈RH×W .
Then we use Gaussian blur to generate a degraded image.

Finally, we use A∗
k as the weight of original image and de-
graded image:
I′ = I × (1 −A∗
k) + Id × A∗
k
(6)
Attention guided data augmentation helps to train the
models in two aspects. Firstly, it can add blurry to some
regions which ensure the model to learn more robust fea-
tures from other regions. Alternatively, AGDA can erase
the most saliently discriminative region by chance, which
forces different attention maps focusing their response on
different targets. Moreover, the AGDA mechanism can pre-
vent a single attention region from expanding too much and
encourage the attention blocks to explore various attention
region dividing forms.
4. Experiments
In this section, we ﬁrst explore the optimal settings for
our proposed multi-attentional framework and then present
extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effective-
ness of our method.
4.1. Implement Details
For all real/fake video frames, we use a state-of-the-art
face extractor RetinaFace[8] to detect faces and save the
aligned facial images as inputs with a size of 380 × 380.
We set hyper-parameters α = 0.05 in Equation 4, and de-
cayed by 0.9 after each epoch. The inter-class margin mout
in Equation 3 is set to 0.2. The intra-class margin min are
set as 0.05 and 0.1 respectively for real and fake images.
We choose quantity of attention maps M, SLa and SLt
by experiments. In AGDA we set the resize factor 0.3 and
Gaussian blur σ = 7. Our models are trained with Adam
optimizer[20] with learning rate 0.001 and weight decay 1e-
6. We train our models on 4 RTX 2080Ti GPUs with batch
size 48.
4.2. Determination of SLa and SLt
In this paper, we adopt EfﬁcientNet-b4[39] as the
backbone network of our multi-attentional framework.
EfﬁcientNet-b4 is able to achieve comparable performance
to XceptionNet [3] with only half FLOPs. There are 7 main

layers in total of EfﬁcientNet, which are denoted from L1-
L7, respectively.
As mentioned above, we observe that subtle artifacts
tend to be preserved by textural features from shallow layers
of the network, thus we choose L2 and L3 as the candidates
of SLt. Conversely, we want the attention maps to attend to
different regions of the input, which needs the guidance of
high-level semantic information to some extent. Therefore,
we use deeper stage L4 and L5 as the candidates of SLa.
By default setting M = 1, we train models with four com-
binations on FF++(HQ). From the results in Table 1, we ﬁnd
that the model reaches best performance when using L2 for
SLt and L5 for SLa.
4.3. Comparison with Previous Methods
In this section, we compare our framework with current
state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods. We evaluate
the performance on FF++ [34] and DFDC [9], respectively.
And we further evaluate the cross-dataset performance on
Celeb-DF [25] in Section 4. We adopt ACC (accuracy) and
AUC (area under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
as the evaluation metrics for extensive experiments.
4.3.1
Evaluation on FaceForensics++
FaceForensics++[34] is the most widely used dataset in
many deepfake detection approaches, it contains 1000
original real videos from internet and each real video
corresponds to 4 forgery ones, which are manipulated
by Deepfakes,
NeuralTextures[40],
FaceSwap[48] and
Face2Face[41], respectively.
In the training process, we
augment the original frames 4 times for real/fake label bal-
ance. We adopt EfﬁcientNet-B4 as the backbone of our

and LQ (c40) version, respectively. Specially, when train-

The results in Table 2 demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HQ version of
FF++. And the performances of different backbone veri-
ﬁes that our framework is not restricted by the backbone
networks. However, the performance decreases 1.5% com-

a speciﬁcally designed method for high-compressed deep-
fake videos detection. This is mainly because the videos
in FF++(LQ) are highly compressed and cause a signiﬁcant
loss in textural information, which is a disaster to our tex-
ture enhancement designing. The results also reveal a limi-
tation of our framework, that is, our framework is sensitive
to high compression rate which blurs most of the useful in-
formation in spatial domain. We will make our framework
more robust to compression in the future.

Evaluating on DFDC Dataset
DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) is the most re-
cently released largest scale deepfake detection dataset, this
dataset is public on the Deepfake Detection Challenge or-
ganized by Facebook in 2020. Currently, it is the most chal-
lenging dataset for deepfake detection task due to the excel-
lent forgery quality of fake videos in this dataset. Seldom
previous methods have been conducted on this dataset thus
we train our model on the training set of this dataset and
only compare the logloss score with the winning teams’
methods of the DFDC contest. Here the provided logloss
scores are calculated on the DFDC testing set(Ref. to Table
2 of [9]), which is one part of DFDC private set. Smaller
logloss represent a better performance. The results in Ta-
ble 3 demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-
art performance on DFDC dataset.

Cross-dataset Evaluation on Celeb-DF
In this part, we evaluate the transferability of our frame-
work, that is trained on FF++(HQ) with multiple forgery
methods but tested on Celeb-DF [25]. We sample 30 frames
for each video to calculate the frame-level AUC scores.
The results are shown in Table 4. Our method shows bet-
ter transferability than most existing methods. Two-branch
[26] achieves the state-of-the-art performance in transfer-
ability, however, its in-dataset AUC is far behind ours.

Effectiveness of Multiple Attentions
To conﬁrm the effectiveness of using multiple attentions,
we evaluate how the quantity of attention maps affect the
accuracy and transferability of our model. We train mod-
els in our framework with different attention quantities M
on FF++(HQ), the other hyper-parameters are kept same as
settings in Table 2. For the single attentional model, we do
not use the regional independence loss and AGDA.

Figure 4: Attention maps trained without regional indepen-
dence loss (RIL) and AGDA. Without RIL and AGDA, the
network is easily degraded and the multiple attention maps
locates the same regions of input.
Celeb-DF are reported in table Table 5.
In some cases,
multi-attention based models perform better than the sin-
gle attentional model, and we found that M = 4 provides
the best performance.
4.4.2
Ablation Study on Regional Independence Loss
and AGDA
As mentioned above, the regional independence loss and
AGDA play an important role in regularized multiple atten-
tion maps training. In this part, we execute quantitative ex-
periments and give some visualizations to demonstrate that
these two components are necessary.
First, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our regional in-
dependence loss, we compare the performances of the mod-
els trained with different auxiliary losses. We keep all the
settings identical with previous except for the loss function.
With the same motivation in designing auxiliary loss, we
substitute the regional independence loss with Additive An-
gular Margin softmax(AMS)[42] that can also force feature
vectors close to their center.
Then we verify the effectiveness of our design for
AGDA. As mentioned, we blur the original image to de-
grade the selected region of input.
Thus the strategy of
AGDA can be regarded as a “soft attention dropping”. In
this part, we alternatively adopt a “hard attention dropping”,
which directly erases pixels of selected region by binary at-

independence loss and the AGDA strategy, we visualize the
attention maps of models trained with/without these two
components. Figure 4 illustrate the attention maps without
RIL, it shows a clear trend that all attention maps are fo-
cused on same region. Figure 5 demonstrate that, although
the attention regions are separated under the retraining of
RIL, the different regions still exhibit similar response to the
most salient features such as landmarks. This is not conduc-
tive for multiple attention maps to capture divergent infor-
mation from different regions. While Figure 6 veriﬁes that
when both RIL and soft AGDA are adopted, the attention
maps show response in discriminative regions with diverse
semantic representations.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we research the deepfake detection from
a novel perspective that is formulating the deepfake detec-
tion task as a ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation problem. We pro-
pose a multi-attentional deepfake detection framework. The
proposed framework explores discriminative local regions
by multiple attention maps, and enhances texture features
from shallow layers to capture more subtle artifacts. Then
the low-level textural feature and high-level semantic fea-
tures are aggregated guided by the attention maps. A re-
gional independence loss function and attention guided data
augmentation mechanism are introduced to help train dis-
entangled multiple attentions. Our method achieves good
improvements in extensive metrics.
