Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test
Matthias Egger, George Davey Smith, Martin Schneider, Christoph Minder
Abstract
Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates
against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in
meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large
trials. We examined whether a simple test of
asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of
results when meta-analyses are compared to large
trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in
published meta-analyses.
Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of
a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance
of results was assumed if effects were in the same
direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within
30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37
meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four
leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38
meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot
asymmetry as measured by the intercept from
regression of standard normal deviates against
precision.
Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large
trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular
medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from
geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there
were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all
cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing
larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in
three out of four discordant pairs but in none of
concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses
and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry
indicated that there was bias.
Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots
provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in
meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be
limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited
number of small trials the results from such analyses
should be treated with considerable caution.
Introduction
Systematic reviews of the best available evidence
regarding the benefits and risks of medical interven-
tions can inform decision making in clinical practice
and public health.
1 2 Such reviews are, whenever possi-
ble, based on meta-analysis: “a statistical analysis which
combines or integrates the results of several independ-
ent clinical trials considered by the analyst to be ‘com-
binable.’ ”
3 However, the findings of some meta-
analyses
have
later
been
contradicted
by
large
randomised controlled trials.
4 Such discrepancies have
brought discredit on a technique that has been contro-
versial since the outset.
5 The appearance of misleading
meta-analysis
is
not
surprising
considering
the
existence of publication bias and the many other biases
that may be introduced in the process of locating,
selecting, and combining studies.
6-9
Funnel plots, plots of the trials’ effect estimates
against sample size, may be useful to assess the validity
of meta-analyses.
4 10 The funnel plot is based on the
fact
that
precision
in
estimating
the
underlying
treatment effect will increase as the sample size of
component studies increases. Results from small stud-
ies will scatter widely at the bottom of the graph, with
the spread narrowing among larger studies. In the
absence of bias the plot will resemble a symmetrical
inverted funnel. Conversely, if there is bias, funnel plots
will often be skewed and asymmetrical.
The value of the funnel plot has not been
systematically examined, and symmetry (or asymme-
try) has generally been defined informally, through
visual examination. Unsurprisingly, funnel plots have
been interpreted differently by different observers.
11
We measured funnel plot asymmetry numerically and
examined the extent to which such asymmetry predicts
discordance of results when meta-analyses are com-
pared to single large trials of the same issue. We used
the same method to assess the prevalence of funnel
plot asymmetry, and thus of possible bias, among
meta-analyses published in leading general medicine
journals and meta-analyses disseminated electronically
by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Methods
Measures of funnel plot asymmetry
We used a linear regression approach to measure fun-
nel plot asymmetry on the natural logarithm scale of
the odds ratio. This corresponds to a regression analy-
sis of Galbraith’s radial plot,
12 although in the present
context the regression is not constrained to run
through the origin. The standard normal deviate
(SND), defined as the odds ratio divided by its standard
error, is regressed against the estimate’s precision, the
latter being defined as the inverse of the standard error
(regression equation: SND = a + b × precision). As pre-
cision depends largely on sample size, small trials will
be close to zero on the x axis. Small trials may produce
an odds ratio that differs from unity, but because the

standard error will be large, the resulting standard nor-
mal deviate will again be close to zero. Small trials will
thus be close to zero on both axes—that is, close to the
origin. Conversely, large studies will produce precise
estimates and, if the treatment is effective, also produce
large standard normal deviates. The points from a
homogeneous set of trials, not distorted by selection
bias, will thus scatter about a line that runs through the
origin at standard normal deviate zero (a = 0), with the
slope b indicating the size and direction of effect.
12 This
situation corresponds to a symmetrical funnel plot.
If there is asymmetry, with smaller studies showing
effects that differ systematically from larger studies, the
regression line will not run through the origin. The
intercept a provides a measure of asymmetry—the
larger its deviation from zero the more pronounced
the asymmetry. If the smaller studies show big protec-
tive effects, they will force the regression line below the
origin on the logarithmic scale. Negative values will
therefore indicate that smaller studies show more pro-
nounced beneficial effects than larger studies. In some
situations (for example, if there are several small trials
but only one larger study) power is gained by weight-
ing the analysis by the inverse of the variance of the
effect estimate. We performed both weighted and
unweighted analyses and used the output from the
analysis yielding the intercept with the larger deviation
from zero.
In contrast to the overall test of heterogeneity, the
test for funnel plot asymmetry assesses a specific type
of heterogeneity and provides a more powerful test in
this situation. However, any analysis of heterogeneity
depends on the number of trials included in a
meta-analysis, which is generally small, and this limits
the statistical power of the test. We therefore based evi-
dence of asymmetry on P < 0.1, and we present
intercepts with 90% confidence intervals. The same
significance level has been used in previous analyses of
heterogeneity in meta-analysis.

Identification of meta-analyses and matching large
randomised trials
A
Medline
search
(Knight
Ridder
Information
Services, Berne, Switzerland) covering the period Janu-
ary 1985 to April 1996 was performed in April 1996 to
identify published meta-analyses. For this purpose the
word “meta-analysis” was entered in a free text search.
The articles identified included all those indexed with
the
Medical
Subject
Heading
(MeSH)
keyword
“meta-analysis,” which was introduced in 1989, and
articles without the keyword which carried the word
meta-analysis in their title or abstract. Results were
tabulated by source of publication, and the items pub-
lished in journals which yielded 30 or more hits were
examined further. Meta-analyses of controlled trials
combining at least five trials with binary endpoints
were identified.
Large scale randomised controlled trials of the
same interventions which had been published after the
meta-analyses were identified by a Medline search
using appropriate keywords. Large trials had to
provide an effect estimate with a precision of at least 5.
For example, a trial among patients with heart failure
in which mortality in the control group at three
months is 5%
15 and in which mortality is reduced to 3%
among treated patients will need to randomise 2800
patients to measure this effect with a precision of 5 and
about 12 000 patients for a precision of 10. Also, the
effect estimate from the large trials had to be of equal
or greater precision than the meta-analysis. We scruti-
nised potential matching pairs of meta-analyses and
large trials with regard to study participants, interven-
tions, end points and lengths of follow up. In some
cases a further Medline search was performed to iden-
tify a meta-analysis published in any journal indexed in
Medline which would be more suitable for comparison
with the large trial.
Some meta-analyses were published several years
before the corresponding large trial. In these cases we
examined whether the shape of the funnel plot
changed when the meta-analysis was updated with tri-
als published in the intervening period.
Concordance and discordance of results
Comparison of results from meta-analyses and large
trials required expressing results on a common scale.
Odds ratios were used for this purpose. The meta-
analysis and the large trial were considered concordant
when effects were in the same direction and the
estimates from the meta-analysis were within 30% of the
estimate of the single trial. A difference of 30% was pro-
posed by Villar et al to denote high similarity between
the results from meta-analyses and large trials.
11
SAS version 6.11 software package (Statistical
Analysis System, Cary, NC) was used for statistical
analysis.

Frequency of asymmetry in funnel plots
We performed a hand search of four leading general
medicine journals, Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ,
JAMA, and Lancet, from 1993 to 1996 and examined
the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of
Systematic
Reviews
16
to
identify
meta-analyses
of
controlled trials. Analyses that were based on at least
five trials with categorical end points were examined
further. For each intervention and comparison, the
outcome measure which was reported in the largest
number of trials was selected. To obtain consistency
across reviews, end points were recoded if necessary so
that the direction of effect for the expected beneficial
outcome was in the same direction. For example, in a
review
of
trials
of
nicotine
patches
in
smoking
cessation, continued smoking rather than quitting was
considered to be the outcome, so that an odds ratio
above unity indicates an adverse effect.
We identified 38 Cochrane reviews and 37 journal
meta-analyses. All references of meta-analyses and tri-
als included are available from the authors on request.
Results
Eight pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a large
trial were identified (table 1).
14 15-30 Five were from
cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine,
one from geriatric medicine, and one from perinatal
medicine. Effect estimates from meta-analyses had an
average precision of 7.9 compared with 14.4 for large
trials. There were four concordant pairs
15 17-22 26 and
four discordant pairs
14 23-25 27-30 (fig 1). In all cases
discordance was a consequence of the meta-analyses
showing more beneficial effects than the large trials.
Three out of four discordant meta-analyses showed
significant (P < 0.1) funnel plot asymmetry; funnel
plots from concordant pairs showed no significant
asymmetry (fig 2, table 2).
Additional trials were identified for three meta-
analyses published several years earlier than the large
trial.
26 27 29 These were extracted from more recent
meta-analyses.

with
five
additional
trials
the
intercept
indicated
even
greater
asymmetry
( −1.36
(90%
confidence interval −2.06 to −0.66), P = 0.005). When
13 additional trials were added to the analysis of trials
of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart
failure the plot remained symmetrical (intercept 0.07
( −0.53 to 0.67), P = 0.85). When the analysis of aspirin
for the prevention of pre-eclampsia was updated with
nine
additional
trials,
the
funnel
plot
became
asymmetrical (intercept
−1.49 ( −2.20 to
−0.79),
P = 0.003) (fig 3).
Figure 4 shows the distribution of regression inter-
cepts from 38 Cochrane reviews and 37 journal meta-
analyses. In the absence of bias, random fluctuations
should produce a symmetrical distribution of inter-
cepts around a central value of zero, with an equal
number of positive and negative values. This is not
what was observed. Distributions were shifted towards
negative values, with a mean of −0.24 ( −0.65 to 0.17)
for Cochrane reviews and −1.00 ( −1.50 to −0.49) for
journal meta-analyses There were 24 negative and 14
positive intercepts among Cochrane reviews (P = 0.10
by sign test) and 26 negative and 11 positive intercepts
among journal meta-analyses (P = 0.007 by sign test).
In five (13%) Cochrane reviews and 14 (38%) journal
meta-analyses
there
was
evidence
of
significant
(P < 0.1) asymmetry.
Discussion
The selective publication of positive findings from ran-
domised controlled trials is an important concern in
meta-analytic reviews of the literature.
9 If the literature
is more likely to contain trials showing beneficial
effects of treatments, and if equally valid trials showing
no effect remain unpublished, how can systematic
reviews of this literature serve as an objective guide to
decision making in clinical practice and health policy?
The
potentially
serious
consequences
of
such
publication bias have been realised for some time, and
there
have
been
repeated
calls
for
worldwide
registration
of
clinical
trials
at
inception.
1 4 33-35
Although registration of trials and creation of a
database holding the results of both published and
unpublished trials would solve the problem, it is
unlikely that this will be widely instituted in the
foreseeable future.
Critical examination for the presence of publication
and related biases must therefore become an essential
part of meta-analytic studies and systematic reviews. The
findings presented here indicate that a simple graphical
and statistical method is useful for this purpose. When
testing this method on pairs consisting of meta-analyses
and single large trials of the same intervention, we found
asymmetry in funnel plots in three out of four pairs with
discordant results. The fourth was based on only six tri-
als, and asymmetry emerged when it was updated with
further studies.
Sources of funnel plot asymmetry
Publication bias has long been associated with funnel
plot asymmetry.
10 Among published studies, however,
the
probability
of
identifying
relevant
trials
for
meta-analysis is also influenced by their results. English
language bias—the preferential publication of “nega-
tive” findings in journals published in languages other
than English—makes the location and inclusion of such
studies less likely.
8 As a consequence of citation bias,
“negative” studies are quoted less frequently and are
therefore more likely to be missed in the search for rel-
evant trials.
7 36 Results of “positive” trials are sometimes
reported more than once, increasing the probability
that they will be located for meta-analysis (multiple
publication bias).
37 These biases are likely to affect
smaller studies to a greater degree than large trials.

Another source of asymmetry arises from differ-
ences in methodological quality. Smaller studies are, on
average,
conducted
and
analysed
with
less
methodological rigour than larger studies. Trials of
lower quality also tend to show the larger effects.
38-40 The
degree of symmetry found in a funnel plot may depend
on the statistic used to measure effect. Odds ratios over-
estimate the relative reduction, or increase, in risk if the
event rate is high.
41 This can lead to funnel plot
asymmetry if the smaller trials were consistently
conducted in patients at higher risk. Similarly, if events
accrue at a constant rate, relative risks will move towards
unity with increasing length of follow up. In large trials,
follow up is often longer than in small studies. Finally,
an asymmetrical funnel plot may arise by chance.
The trials displayed in a funnel plot may not
estimate the same underlying effect of the intervention,
and such heterogeneity between results may lead to
asymmetry in funnel plots. For example, if a combined
outcome is considered then substantial benefit may be
seen only in patients at high risk for the component of
the combined outcome that is affected by the interven-
tion.
42
A
cholesterol
lowering
drug
that
reduces
mortality from coronary heart disease will have a
greater effect on all cause mortality in high risk
patients with established cardiovascular disease than in
asymptomatic patients with isolated hypercholestero-
laemia. This is because a consistent relative reduction
in mortality from coronary heart disease will translate
into a greater relative reduction in all cause mortality
in high risk patients, in whom a greater proportion of
all deaths will be from coronary heart disease. This will
produce asymmetry in funnel plots if the smaller trials
were performed in high risk patients.
Small trials are generally conducted before larger
trials are established. In the intervening years, control
treatments may have improved or changed in a way
that could reduce the efficacy of the experimental
treatment. Such a mechanism has been proposed as an
explanation for the discrepant results obtained in clini-
cal trials of the effect of magnesium infusion in
myocardial infarction,
43 although this interpretation is
not supported by the data from clinical trials.
44 Finally,
some interventions may have been implemented less
thoroughly in larger trials, thus explaining the more
positive results in smaller trials. This could have
occurred in one of the interventions considered in our
comparison of meta-analysis and single large trials,
inpatient geriatric consultation.
14
Very different mechanisms can thus lead to asym-
metry in funnel plots, as summarised in the box. It is
important to note, however, that this will always be
associated with a biased overall estimate of effect when
studies are combined in a meta-analysis. The more
pronounced the asymmetry, the more likely it is that
the amount of bias will be substantial. The exception
to this rule arises when asymmetry is produced by
chance alone.
How frequent is bias in meta-analysis?
Several studies have recently tried to evaluate the valid-
ity
of
meta-analysis.
Villar
et
al
analysed
38
meta-analyses from the pregnancy and childbirth
module of the 1993 Cochrane database by comparing
the results from the largest trial with the remaining
smaller studies.
45 On the basis of the direction of
estimates of treatment effects, they concluded that 80%
of meta-analyses were in total or partial agreement
with the results from the larger “gold standard” trial. In
a
similar
study,
Cappelleri
et
al
analysed
79
meta-analyses and concluded that there was agree-
ment between smaller trials and large trials in over
80%.
13 In both these analyses, however, the precision of
the large trials was low in a sizeable proportion of
comparisons. The larger trials in fact often provided an
estimate of lower precision than the meta-analysis of
the smaller studies. In this situation, concordance
between the two could simply be due to the fact that
estimates with large, overlapping confidence intervals
are unlikely to be classified as discordant.
46
We thought that stringent criteria were necessary
for identifying single large trials that could sensibly be
used to assess the results from meta-analyses of smaller
trials. As a result, the large trials used in our analysis on
average provided an estimate of considerably greater
precision
that
the
corresponding
meta-analyses.
Despite an extensive literature search, we identified only
eight such pairs. The matched pair approach may
therefore not be suitable assessing the frequency of
misleading meta-analysis. However, our results indicate
that an asymmetrical funnel plot makes bias likely. The
prevalence of funnel plot asymmetry may thus provide
a useful proxy measure to examine the prevalence of
biased analyses in the literature. Our findings indicate
that bias may be present in a small proportion of meta-
analyses published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews. Bias may be considerably more prevalent, how-
ever,
among
meta-analyses
published
in
leading
general medicine journals. Whether such bias is likely
to affect the conclusions of a systematic review or meta-
analysis must be carefully assessed for each case.
Begg and Mazumbar proposed a rank correlation
test to measure asymmetry in funnel plots.
47 The method
is based on the degree of association between the size of
effect estimates and their variances. If publication bias is
present, the smaller studies will show the larger effects. A
positive correlation between effect size and variance
emerges in this situation because the variance of the
estimates from smaller studies will also be large. When
we applied their test to the eight meta-analyses, it

indicates that the linear regression approach may be
more powerful than the rank correlation test.
Conclusions
In the absence of large, conclusive trials for most medi-
cal interventions, systematic reviews based on ran-
domised controlled trials are clearly the best strategy for
appraising the evidence. Selection bias and other biases
pose a serious threat to the validity of this approach,
however, and care must be taken to avoid meta-analysis
becoming discredited. The technique discussed here
should contribute to this goal, providing a reproducible
measure for the likely presence, or apparent absence, of
such biases. It is easily calculated and provides summary
statistics that can be reported when space limitations do
not permit the display of funnel plots. Though more
methodological
research
is
required,
the
critical
examination for the presence of publication and related
biases should be considered a routine procedure. The
capacity to unearth such bias will, however, be limited
when meta-analyses are based exclusively on small
trials. There is no statistical solution in this situation,
and the results from such analyses should therefore be
treated with caution.

Key messages
x Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for
appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses
were later contradicted by large trials
x Funnel plots, plots of the trials’ effect estimates against sample size,
are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias
and other biases
x Funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts
discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with
single large trials
x Funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses
published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of
reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
x Critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and
related biases should be considered a routine procedure

==================================================

Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of
