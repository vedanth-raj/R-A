Abstract
Canonical FGFs activate FGF receptors (FGFR) via paracrine or autocrine mechanisms, in a 
process requiring cooperation with heparan sulfate proteoglycans that function as co-receptors for 
FGFR activation1,2. By contrast, endocrine FGFs (FGF 19, 21, and 23) are circulating hormones 
that regulate critical metabolic processes in a variety of tissues3,4. FGF19 regulates bile acid 
synthesis and lipogenesis, while FGF21 stimulate insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and 
weight loss5. Endocrine FGFs signal through FGFRs in a manner that requires Klothos, which are 
cell surface proteins with tandem glycosidase domains3,4. Here we describe the crystal structures 
of free and ligand-bound β-Klotho extracellular regions, revealing the molecular mechanism 
underlying the specificity of FGF21 towards β-Klotho and demonstrating how FGFR is activated 
in a Klotho-dependent manner. β-Klotho serves as a primary “Zip code”-like receptor for FGF21 
with an FGFR functioning as a catalytic subunit that mediates intracellular signaling. Our 
structures also show how a sugar cutting enzyme (glycosidase) has evolved to become a specific 
receptor for hormones that regulate metabolic processes including lowering of blood sugar. 
Finally, we describe a superior agonistic variant of FGF21 and present structural insights offering 
development of novel therapeutics for diseases linked to endocrine FGFs.
To elucidate the mechanism of action of β-Klotho in cell signaling via FGF21 stimulation 
we used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of free and ligand bound 
extracellular region of human β-Klotho (sKLB) (Extended Data Fig.1, Methods). The 
overall structure of sKLB (2.2 Å resolution, Extended Data Table 1) features two tandem 
glycoside hydrolase-like (GH) domains, D1 (residues 53–507) and D2 (residues 521–968),

that are connected by an unstructured and flexible linker (Fig. 1a). Each GH domain can be 
recognized by multiple repeats of alternating β-sheet (S) and α-helix (H) that define the 
(β/α)8 fold (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The structure of KLBD1 (1.7 Å resolution, Extended 
Data Table 1), shown in Fig. 1b, is virtually identical to the structure of D1 in the context of 
sKLB (with overall Cα RMSD of 0.48 Å). Four loop regions in the structure of sKLB 
containing potential N-glycosylation sites could not be modeled due to poor electron 
density: a loop between H0 and S1 (residues 63–73), a loop between H1b and H1c (residues 
119–125), a loop between S9 and H9a (residues 538–574), and the C-terminus (residues 
968–983) of the protein (Extended Data Fig. 2a). With the exception of the C-terminus, 
these loops are depicted in the sKLB structures as dashed lines (Fig. 1a).
Superimposing the structure of human cytosolic β-glucosidase (PDB: 2ZOX) on the 
structures of each of the two GH domains in sKLB domains gives Cα RMSDs of 1.08 Å for 
D1 and 1.39 Å for D2, demonstrating the strong similarity of both D1 and D2 to the 
glycoside hydrolase family-1 (GH1) of enzymes (Fig. 1d and 1e). The GH1 family of 
proteins are enzymes that hydrolyze glycosidic linkages between carbohydrate moieties 
(http://www.cazy.org/GH1.html) through a double-replacement mechanism mediated by two 
conserved glutamates located in their active site6. Intriguingly, one of the two catalytic 
glutamates is replaced by another amino acid in each of the sKLB domains (Fig. 1d-f). The 
first glutamate in D1 is replaced by N241, whereas the second glutamate in D2 is replaced 
by A889, indicating that neither GH domain in β-Klotho can function as an active glycoside-
hydrolase enzyme. Structural alignment using the Dali server7 indicates that GH1 and GH5 
members exhibit high structural similarities to each of the GH domains of sKLB, implying a 
common evolutionary origin. Although the overall structures of the GH domains in sKLB 
are very similar to GH1 family enzymes, the two sKLB GH domains exhibit important 
structural features that set them apart from the GH1 family of enzymes.
The pocket in D1 that corresponds to the substrate-binding region in GH1 family enzymes is 
largely occluded by a short helix, H6a (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig 3a). Moreover, a 
helix-turn-strand element (H6a-turn-S6b) in this region, specific to β-Klotho D1 (green in 
Fig. 1d), provides part of the FGF21 binding site (see below) and is quite distinct from the 
strand-helix-strand element in corresponding regions of cytosolic β-glucosidase (grey in Fig. 
1d). Other features unique to β-Klotho include a short helix, H0 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data 
Fig. 3b), which begins with the first amino acid following the sKLB signal sequence (F53). 
This helix interacts with H5a, H6b and S5b, mostly through hydrophobic interactions, and 
precedes a disordered loop that is followed by the core structural elements of the (β/α)8 fold. 
Interestingly, E416, the remaining “catalytic” residue in D1 is located at the bottom of the 
substrate binding pocket (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3a) and the orientation of the side 
chain of E416 is identical to the orientation of the side chain of the corresponding 
nucleophilic E373 residue of human cytosolic β-glucosidase.
The pocket in D2 that corresponds to the substrate binding pocket in GH1 family enzymes is 
not occluded by an alpha-helix in the D2 domain, but is instead accessible and occupied by a 
MES molecule from the crystallization buffers (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the morpholine ring 
of MES interacts with aromatic rings from three phenylalanines, F931, F826, and F942 (Fig. 
1c), which also play a role in the interaction of sKLB with its ligands (see below). The D2

pocket is accessible in part because of the existence of a disordered region between S9 and 
H9a (Extended Data Fig. 2a), resulting in formation of a more groove-like feature in this 
domain rather than the pocket that accommodates substrate in the active site of GH1 family 
members. The amino acid sequence and the length of this region vary significantly among 
GH1 family members. The inter-domain interface of sKLB is comprised of an extensive 
network of both hydrophobic and polar interactions (Extended Data Fig. 3c) encompassing a 
buried surface area8 of about 680 Å2.
Next, we determined the structure of sKLB in complex with C-terminal tail (CT) of FGF21 
(FGF21CT) at 2.6 Å resolution (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 1). The final model 
contains amino acids P186 to S209 from FGF21CT bound to sKLB (Extended Data Fig. 4a-
c) and exhibited clear electron density for FGF21CT lying across the middle of sKLB (Fig. 
2b). FGF21CT binds to an elongated interface that spans D1 and D2 of sKLB with no 
influence on the structure of either individual domain as judged by α-carbon RMSDs of 0.33 
and 0.49 Å for D1 and D2, respectively, when overlaid on the unoccupied sKLB structure. A 
small change in the inter-domain angle9 of 6˚ was seen upon FGF21CT binding to sKLB 
(Extended Data Fig. 4d). The FGF21CT-binding region on sKLB is located on the opposite 
side of the molecule from the linker that connects D1 and D2. Flexibility of the linker may 
contribute to the inter-domain dynamic properties that enable complex formation with 
ligands and FGFRs. Intriguingly, the sKLB:FGF21CT structure shows two distinct binding 
sites for two different regions of the peptide. Site 1 is located on D1, and site 2 is located in 
D2 with a distance of 30 Å between the two sites.
Site 1 on sKLB D1 engages amino acids P186-V197 of FGF21CT, primarily through 
hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 4a-b). Site 1 involves a surface 
created on D1 by H6a, H7, the loop between S6b and H6b, and the loop between S7 and H7. 
Most strikingly, the region of the bound peptide ligand that associates with site 1 adopts an 
unusually compact and rigid structure through the formation of several well-defined turns 
(Fig. 2e), as follows: (1) D187-V188-G189-S190 form a type I β-turn (orange in Fig. 2e) 
through hydrogen bonding of the carboxyl oxygen of D187 with the backbone nitrogen of 
G189 and of the backbone carbonyl of D176 with the backbone amide of S190; (2) S190-
S191-D192 form an ST turn (yellow in Fig. 2e) through hydrogen bonding of the S190 
hydroxyl with the backbone amide of D192; (3) D192-P193-L194-S195 (light blue in Fig. 
2e) form a type I β-turn (or an Asx turn that resembles a Schellman loop) through hydrogen 
bonding of the side chain carboxyl of D192 with the M196 and V197 backbone amides and 
of the D192 backbone carbonyl with the backbone amide of S195. These consecutive turns 
also support a long-range hydrogen bond between the D187 backbone amide and the P193 
carbonyl. These intramolecular interactions cooperate to form a well-defined structural 
element that makes multiple specific contacts with sKLB, burying a relatively large surface 
area of 606 Å2.
Site 2 interactions with FGF21CT contrasts starkly with site 1 interactions, comprising a 
network of inter-molecular interactions of the sort typically observed between proteins and 
short peptides (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4a-b). Interestingly, residues 200–209 of the 
FGF21CT peptide project into what would be the substrate-binding site occupied by 
glycosides that D2 of sKLB would hydrolyze if it were an active GH1 enzyme (Fig. 3 and 
Lee et al.

see below). It is also noteworthy that the sequence of this part of FGF21CT (S-Q-G-R-S-P-S-
Y-A-S) is rich (50%) in residues with side-chain hydroxyl groups, suggesting the possibility 
that this region of FGF21 may indeed mimic a glycoside substrate. Given these 
characteristics, a fascinating feature of site 2 is the interaction between the side-chain 
carboxyl group of E693 in sKLB with hydroxyl groups of both S204 and S206 in FGF21CT 
(Fig. 3d). E693 corresponds to one of the two conserved “catalytic” glutamates, and would 
function as a general acid/base catalyst in the Koshland double-displacement reaction of 
glycoside hydrolases (whereas the potential nucleophilic glutamate is replaced by alanine in 
D2).
Amino acids 198–200 of FGF21CT, which connect the ligand binding site 1 and site 2, do 
not make significant contacts with sKLB. In addition, the electron densities in omit maps 
(Fig. 2b) and B-factors (Fig. 2c) suggest that this region is flexible. This conclusion is 
consistent with identification of an enzyme that cleaves FGF21 in this region, and is known 
to abolish its binding to β-Klotho11–16. As this region of FGF21 is flexible and potentially 
accessible for proteolysis, cleavage between the site 1 and site 2 binding regions could 
represent a mechanism of termination of FGF21 signaling by targeted proteolysis.
The crystal structure of sKLB bound to FGF21CT reveals how the basic framework of a 
glycoside hydrolase has evolved to become a specific receptor for endocrine FGFs. The β-
glucosidase family of glycoside hydrolases catalyzes the hydrolysis of disaccharides as well 
as longer oligosaccharides, and several crystal structures of β-glucosidases in complex with 
oligosaccharide substrates such as cellotetraose (P. polymyxa BglB, PDB: 2Z1S) or 
cellopentaose (O. sativa BGlu1, PDB: 3F5K) have been determined17,18. Superimposition of 
the crystal structures of substrate-bound β-glucosidases with the structure of sKLB in 
complex with FGF21CT shows that the backbone of residues 200–209 from FGF21CT aligns 
very well with the location of oligosaccharides that occupy the catalytic pocket of β-
glucosidases (Fig. 3a-c). As mentioned above, the mode of interaction between the 
hydroxyls of S204 and S206 from FGF21CT and the “catalytic” glutamate in D2 of sKLB, 
together with the hydrophobic interactions involving P205, are highly reminiscent of 
substrate interactions seen for the glycoside hydrolases6 suggesting that this is a pseudo-
substrate like interaction (Fig. 3d). Oligosaccharide substrates bound to this catalytic 
glutamic acid in β-glucosidases active sites lie in precisely the same position as the S204-
P205-S206 motif of FGF21 bound to site 2 of sKLB. In addition, the residues in sKLB that 
form hydrophobic interactions with P205 of FGF21, i.e., F826, F931, and F942, align well 
with the corresponding hydrophobic residues in β-glucosidases. These unexpected 
similarities indicate that the substrate-binding region of glycoside hydrolases evolved to 
recognize a sugar-mimicking S-P-S motif in FGF21 (Fig. 3e). As FGF19 also binds 
specifically to β-Klotho, it is not surprising that FGF19 also contains a S211-P212-S213 
motif at its C-terminus (Extended Data Fig. 5), whereas FGF23 (which does not bind to β-
Klotho) has no such sequence. Further studies on how FGF23 recognizes α-Klotho should 
provide guidance for development of new treatments of metabolic disorders caused by 
impaired phosphate homeostasis19, and information on a unique evolutionary pathway that 
this family of proteins might have taken.

We next analyzed the binding affinities of FGF21, wild type and various mutants in C-
terminal tail of FGF21 towards sKLB to explore the contributions of different amino acids in 
FGF21 that take part in the interface of ligand-occupied sKLB structure. We also 
investigated the effects of mutations in β-Klotho’s two FGF21CT-binding sites on the ability 
of FGF21 to stimulate FGFR1 activation in transfected L6 myoblasts. These experiments 
validated the ligand binding interfaces identified in the occupied sKLB structure and 
demonstrated that FGF21CT binds in cooperative manner to both site 1 and site 2 in β-
Klotho. Full details about these experiments are presented in Extended Data Fig. 6, 7, and 
Supplementary Discussion.
As endocrine FGFs play important roles in the control of metabolic processes, a variety of 
approaches have been utilized to develop novel therapeutics13,20–25. We reasoned that it 
should be possible to enhance the potency of FGF21 by introducing mutations into its C-
terminal tail that strengthen interactions with β-Klotho. We introduced L194F mutation to 
increase hydrophobic interactions with neighboring amino acids in site 1 of β-Klotho and a 
R203W mutation to replace cation-pi interactions between R203 in FGF21 and H646 in site 
2 of β-Klotho with pi-pi interactions. We found that R203W/L194F-mutated FGF21 
(FGF21WF) bound to sKLB over 10-fold more tightly than wild-type FGF21, with a KD of 
3.4 ± 1.2 nM (Fig. 4a) with enhanced ability to stimulate FGFR1c autophosphorylation and 
MAP kinase stimulation in L6 cells co-expressing β-Klotho and FGFR1c (Fig. 4b and 
Extended Data Fig. 8).
These experiments show that, rather than serving as an alternative co-receptor for FGFR1c 
activation by endocrine FGFs, β-Klotho functions as the primary high affinity receptor for 
FGF21. Importantly, we show that Klotho proteins function as specific ‘Zip code’-like 
signals for targeting FGF21 (or two other endocrine FGFs) to cells and tissues where they 
mediate their cellular responses by activating members of the FGFR families. The scheme 
presented in Fig. 4c depicts a model for how FGF21 binding to β-Klotho allows it to activate 
a β-Klotho/FGFR complex to promote cell signaling. In the model, FGFR1c and β-Klotho 
monomers exist in equilibrium with FGFR/β-Klotho hetero-dimers in the membrane. With a 
KD of ~1 μM for binding of the FGFR1c extracellular region to sKLB (Extended Data Fig. 
6b), a substantial portion of FGFR1c and β-Klotho will be associated with one another at 
levels around 10,000 copies per cell. FGF21 binds with high affinity, KD = 43.5 nM, 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a) either to β-Klotho monomers or to preexisting β-Klotho/FGFR1c 
hetero-dimers. With FGF21 thus tethered via its C-terminal tail to β-Klotho monomers 
and/or β-Klotho/FGFR1c heterodimers, all three components are reduced to two dimensions 
at the membrane and the weak (but demonstrable) affinity of FGF21’s FGF-core for 
FGFR1c is sufficient to drive formation of the activated ternary FGF21/FGFR1c/β-Klotho 
complex via a reduced dimensionality effect on the bivalent binding of FGF to two FGFR 
molecules26. In this model, β-Klotho functions as a primary high affinity receptor for 
FGF21, whereas FGFR1c functions as a catalytic subunit that mediates receptor 
dimerization and intracellular signaling.
The crystal structure of sKLB bound to FGF21CT also provides clear views of how the two 
GH domains of β-Klotho have been ‘repurposed’ in evolution to specifically recognize 
FGF21. Comparing the structures of substrate-bound β-glucosidases to the second GH

domain of FGF21CT-bound β-Klotho reveals how the active-site of an enzyme specialized in 
cutting sugars has evolved to become a specific and high-affinity cell-surface receptor for 
circulating hormones that regulate critical metabolic processes including lowering of blood 
sugars; this may not be a coincidence. Intriguingly, the C-terminus of FGF21 appears to 
present a structural mimic of an oligosaccharide. The similarities between FGF21 and 
FGF19 indicate that the specificity of the two hormones towards β-Klotho and their modes 
of action are very similar (Extended Data Fig. 5). Differences in the cellular responses to 
these two endocrine FGFs are likely to be determined by the altered binding preferences of 
the two ligands for the different FGFRs.
METHODS
Plasmid construction.
cDNA that encode for either amino acids 30–983 (sKLB) or 30–522 (KLBD1) of human β-
Klotho (KLB) were amplified together with the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage 
site and linker of four Gly residues. The resulting sequence was subcloned into a modified 
pCEP4 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) which contains sequence for Fc region of 
human IgG1. The expression vector for C-terminal HA-tagged KLB was generated by 
subcloning the gene of full-length KLB together with the HA-tag sequence into a pBABE 
vector. All plasmids of KLB mutants were generated by following standard site-directed 
mutagenesis protocol using a plasmid containing WT C-terminal HA-tagged KLB.
Expression and purification of sKLB and KLBD1.
HEK293-EBNA cells were cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37˚C in 
DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 
U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 250 μg/mL G-418. The plasmids were transfected into 
HEK293-EBNA cells with the Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 
selected by treatment with 200 μg/mL of hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) for 
2–3 weeks. Cells stably expressing sKLB-Fc or KLBD1-Fc were expanded in Hyperflasks 
(Corning Inc.), and the media was changed to DMEM with 5% FBS when cell confluency 
had reached about 70%. After 7 days, the medium was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 
×g and filtration through 0.2 μm membrane. 15 μM swainsonine (Cayman Chemical) was 
added to the medium of cultured cells when preparing proteins for crystallization.
Media harvested from the cells expressing sKLB-Fc or KLBD1-Fc were incubated with 
recombinant Protein A Sepharose 4B (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) overnight at 4˚C. The 
resin was washed with 50 column volumes of PBS and the protein was eluted from the resin 
using 0.1 M Glycine-HCl, pH 3.5 and immediately neutralized with 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4. The 
eluted protein was incubated with recombinant TEV protease for 2 hours at room 
temperature to cleave the C-terminal Fc-tag, followed by incubation with recombinant 
Protein A Sepharose 4B for 30 min. at 4˚C to remove Fc-tag and undigested protein. The 
protein was then subjected to a cation exchange chromatography (Mono S 5/50 GL, GE 
Healthcare) using 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 (for sKLB) or at pH 6.5 (for 
KLBD1) and purified using a linear salt gradient. The elution fractions containing sKLB or 
KLBD1 were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE

Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. The eluted fractions containing sKLB or KLBD1 were pooled, 
concentrated, flash-frozen, and stored at −80˚C until further use. For crystallization of 
sKLB, two potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn308 and Asn611, were mutated to glutamine. 
The mutations were introduced to the sKLB-Fc plasmid by standard QuikChange site-
directed mutagenesis. The expression and purification of mutant sKLB was identical to those 
used for WT sKLB. Typical yield of sKLB, after complete purification, is 1–2 mg per 1 liter 
of media from the cells stably expressing sKLB.
Expression and purification of recombinant FGF21, GST-FGF21CT, and FGFR1cD2D3.
DNA sequence that encodes for human FGF21 amino acid 29–209 harboring three 
mutations, L126R, P199G, and A208E, was codon-optimized for E.coli expression and 
synthesized (Blue Heron Biotech, LLC.). After cloning into a pET28a vector (Novagen), the 
plasmid was transformed into BL21-Gold (DE3) competent cells. Transformants were 
grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, shaking at 240 rpm at 37˚C. When 
the A600 of the samples reached 0.6, the bacteria were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hours 
at 37˚C. The bacterial cell pellet, collected by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g at 4˚C, was lysed in 
20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, at pH 7.8 using EmulsiFlex-
C3 homogenizer (Avestin, Inc.), followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min. at 4˚C. 
The supernatant containing N-terminal His6-tagged FGF21 was supplemented with 10 mM 
imidazole and incubated with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) for 1 hr at 4˚C. The resin was 
washed with 20 column volume of lysis buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, and the protein 
was eluted from the resin with lysis buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The protein 
solution was injected into HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion 
chromatography column equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 900 mM NaCl at pH 7.5. The 
eluted fractions containing FGF21 were pooled, concentrated to about 1.5 mg/mL, flash-
frozen, and stored at −80˚C until further study. For generating GST-FGF21CT, DNA 
sequence encoding amino acids 169–209 of FGF21 was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE 
Healthcare), and the plasmid was transformed into BL21-Gold (DE3) competent cells 
(Agilent Technologies). Transformants were grown in LB media containing 100 μg/mL 
ampicillin at 37˚C until A600 reached 0.6, and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hours at 37˚C. 
Bacteria cells were collected, lysed in PBS using EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin, 
Inc.), and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 minutes at 4˚C. The supernatant containing GST-
FGF21CT was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated 
with PBS, for 1 hour at 4˚C. The beads were washed with 50 column volume of PBS and the 
protein was eluted with 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 7.3. 
The protein solution containing GST-FGF21CT was then dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, 
150 mM NaCl before flash-freezing and storage at −80˚C. A peptide corresponding to the C-
terminal region of FGF21 containing amino acids 174–209 with two substitutions, P199G 
and A208E, was synthesized and purified by the Tufts University Core Facility. The ligand 
binding region of FGFR1c was expressed in E.coli as an insoluble fraction. The protein was 
refolded and purified as previously described26.

Expression and purification of Nb914.
The plasmid harboring C-terminal His6-tagged Nb914 was transformed into E.coli strain 
WK6, and grown in TB media containing 0.1% glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml 
ampicillin at 37˚C until the A600 of the sample was 1.2, and then induced with 1 mM IPTG 
for 4 hours. Cells were harvested and the periplasmic fraction was extracted using the 
modified osmotic shock protocol27. The periplasmic extract containing Nb914 was 
supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and incubated with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) for 1 
hour at 4˚C. The beads were washed with 50 column volumes of PBS containing 10 mM 
imidazole, and Nb914 was eluted from the resin with PBS containing 300 mM imidazole. 
The eluted fraction containing Nb914 were concentrated and injected into HiLoad 26/600 
Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column pre-equilibrated with 
PBS at pH 7.0. Purified Nb914 at concentration of 10 mg/mL was flash-frozen, and stored at 
−80˚C until further study.
Crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection, and structure determination.
Purified sKLB or KLBD1 was mixed with Nb914, concentrated, and injected into Superdex 
200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column pre-
equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. Eluted fractions containing the 
complex were pooled, concentrated to 7 mg/mL, and screened for crystallization using 
Mosquito Crystal liquid handler (TTP Labtech). 96-well plates were incubated and imaged 
at 20˚C using Rock Imager 1000 (Formulatrix). sKLB in complex with Nb914 gave rod-
shaped crystals when mixed with equal volume of well solution containing 14% PEG4000, 
0.1 M MES, pH 6.0 and equilibrated for 10–15 days using the hanging drop vapor diffusion 
method. The crystals were cryopreserved by gradually transferring crystals to the mother 
liquor supplemented with 30% glucose before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. KLBD1 
in complex with Nb914 gave plate-like crystals when mixed with equal volume of well 
solution containing 30% PEG1000, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 and equilibrated for 4–6 days 
using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, which were directly flash-frozen in liquid 
nitrogen. For sKLB in complex with Nb914 and FGF21CT, FGF21CT was dissolved in 14% 
PEG4000, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0 and added to the drop that contains sKLB. Addition of 
FGF21CT immediately caused deformation in most of the crystals. Crystals that stayed intact 
were gradually transferred into the artificial mother liquor, supplemented with 30% glucose 
and 50 μM FGF21CT before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data was 
collected at the beamlines BL-14 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC 
National Accelerator Laboratory, CA (for KLBD1 and sKLB) and 24-ID-E at the Advanced 
Photon Source, Argonne, IL (for sKLB in complex with FGF21CT). The diffraction data sets 
were processed using HKL200028 and XDS29. Initial phases for the data set for KLBD1 in 
complex with Nb914 were calculated by molecular replacement with PHASER30 using the 
coordinates of the cytosolic β-glucosidase (PDB: 2ZOX) and the coordinates of a nanobody 
that exhibits highest sequence identities with Nb914 (PDB: 5IMK, chain B) as the search 
models. Refinement was iteratively performed using PHENIX31 followed by manual model 
building using COOT32. The final coordinates of KLBD1 in complex with Nb914 was then 
used as a search model for the data set of sKLB in complex with Nb914, together with the 
coordinates for the KLBD1 as a search model for D2 of sKLB. Then the model was 
iteratively built and refined for sKLB. As for the data set for sKLB in complex with Nb914

and FGF21CT, initial phase information was obtained by molecular replacement using the 
final coordinates of sKLB in complex with Nb914, which were divided into two models 
each containing the coordinates for D1 with Nb914 and D2, and searched independently. 
Iterative cycles of refinement and rebuilding of sKLB model improved the phase, resulting 
significant electron densities for FGF21CT. Subsequently, the model for FGF21CT was 
manually built based on the |Fo|-|Fc| map followed by the final refinement cycles. The data 
collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1. All the figures containing 
the structures were generated using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 
(Schrödinger, LLC.).
MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) measurements.
All MST measurements were performed using the Monolith NT.115Pico instrument 
(NanoTemper Technologies) with Monolith NT.115 MST Premium Coated Capillaries. 
Purified FGF21 was fluorescently labeled using the Monolith Protein Labeling Kit RED-
NHS (NanoTemper Technologies) according to the instruction provided by the manufacturer. 
Samples for binding affinity measurements of FGF21 to sKLB were prepared by mixing 35 
nM of fluorescently labeled FGF21 (fl-FGF21) with a series of concentrations, ranging from 
0.03 nM to 1000 nM, of purified sKLB in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, 0.05% 
Tween-20, 1 mg/mL BSA. The thermophoretic movements of fl-FGF21 in each sample were 
monitored (LED 20%, IR laser 20%) and the normalized fluorescence intensities (FNorm), 
defined as Fhot/Fcold (where Fcold and Fhot refer to the fluorescence intensities averaged over 
1s period before IR laser is on and 29 s after IR laser is on, respectively), for each samples 
were plotted against the concentrations of sKLB. For the competition assays, the 
thermophoresis of fl-FGF21 was measured for samples where the concentration of fl-FGF21 
and sKLB mixture was kept constant with the concentrations of GST-FGF21CT varying from 
2.1 nM to 35000 nM. All the data were analyzed with the MO.Affinity Analysis software 
(NanoTemper Technologies) provided by the manufacturer.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) measurements.
All SPR experiments were performed using a BIAcore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 
25 ˚C (Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University) using HPBS
+ buffer (GE Healthcare). Anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare) was immobilized on a CM5 
sensor chip using the instructions provided with the antibody, followed by capturing 50 RU 
of GST-FGF21CT. Subsequently, using the single-cycle kinetics method, a series 
concentration of sKLB, ranging from 25.6 nM to 1000 nM, was injected onto the surfaces 
with 360 s of association period, followed by the dissociation period of 1200 s. The binding 
kinetics were evaluated using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare).
Cell-based activity assays.
L6 cells stably co-expressing WT FGFR1c together with either WT β-Klotho or a variety of 
β-Klotho mutants, were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL 
Penicillin-Streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin and 1 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were starved 
overnight in DMEM with 0.5% FBS and stimulated for 10 minutes at 37˚C with either FGF1 
or FGF21 at concentrations of 5 nM and 25 nM, respectively. Cells were then lysed and 
subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FGFR1 antibody followed by SDS-PAGE. The

samples were then subjected to immunoblotting with either anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr), 
anti-β-Klotho or anti-FGFR1 antibodies.

Following purification using a protein-A agarose resin the KLB-Fc fusion protein was 
subjected to proteolytic cleavage. sKLB was further purified using ion exchange and size 
exclusion chromatography. Multiple crystallization trials with the ternary complex formed 
by sKLB, FGF21 and FGFR1cD2D3 (a, green) failed to yield diffraction quality crystals. 
However, a preparation of sKLB bound to a nanobody, Nb914 (b), yielded crystals that 
diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 6–8 Å, and these were further improved by mutating two 
of the eleven potential N-glycosylation sites in sKLB (N308 and N611) to glutamines. The 
resulting crystals of an sKLB:Nb914 complex diffracted to a resolution of 2.2 Å. We also 
crystallized KLBD1 in complex with Nb914 (c), and collected data to a resolution of 1.7 Å. 
The structure of KLBD1 was first solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of 
a structure of human cytosolic β-glucosidase (PDB: 2ZOX) and the coordinates of a 
nanobody structure (PDB: 5IMK, chain B) as search models. The structure of sKLB was 
subsequently determined by molecular replacement using the KLBD1 coordinates as a search 
model.

b, Seven of the 10 cysteines in the extracellular region were successfully modeled in the 
sKLB structure. With the exception of the disulfide bond between C576 and C625, the 
structure shows that these cysteines are reduced and do not form disulfide bridges.

Moreover, determination of the distances between each pair of cysteines indicates that most 
are too far apart to form intra-molecular disulfide bonds. It cannot be ruled out, however, 
that C976 located in the C terminal region of sKLB (which could not be modeled due to 
weak electron density in this region) may form a disulfide bond with nearby C523. There is 
no evidence for formation of inter-molecular disulfide bonds between β-Klotho and the 
closely associated FGFR, FGF19 or FGF21 proteins whose cysteines all form well 
characterized intramolecular disulfide bonds. The functional consequences of the presence 
of reduced cysteines in β-Klotho are currently unknown.

Extended Data Figure 5 |. Amino acid sequence alignments of C-terminal regions of human 
FGF19 and FGF21.
Residues D-P, which are critical in maintaining multi-turn elements, are highlighted in light 
blue, and the sugar-mimicking motif, S-P-S, is highlighted in yellow. The sequence 
alignment reveals close sequence similarity between the C-terminal tails of FGF21 and 
FGF19 which is consistent with the similar binding characteristics of FGF21 and FGF19 and 
their isolated C-terminal regions to β-Klotho. Importantly, the sugar-mimicking motif in 
FGF21, S205-P206-S207, is conserved in FGF19 (S211-P212-S213). Also highlighted is the 
sequence D192-P193 in the region of FGF21CT that binds to site-1 of β-Klotho by 
stabilizing intramolecular hydrogen bonds that maintain a turn in the bound configuration of 
FGF21CT. This sequence is conserved in FGF19 (D198-P199), suggesting that similar 
intramolecular interactions responsible for mediating consecutive turns in FGF19CT may 
also similarly bind to site-1 of β-Klotho. Moreover, since many of the intramolecular 
interactions within FGF21CT bound to β-Klotho take place between main chain atoms (as 
observed in typical β-turn structures), only few key amino acid sequences such as D198-
P199 may be sufficient for generating a similar multi-turn elements in FGF19CT as observed 
in the crystal structure of FGF21CT bound to β-Klotho.

Figure 4 |. Structure-based engineering of a superior analogue of FGF21 and the mechanism of 
endocrine FGF signaling
a, b, Enhanced binding affinity (a) and bioactivity (b) of an FGF21 mutant. MST binding 
measurements of FGF21 carrying a double L194F/R203W mutations in FGF21CT reveal 
approximately 10-fold increase in binding affinity to sKLB with a KD of 3.4 ± 1.3 nM and 
approximately 10-fold enhanced potency for stimulation of FGFR1c tyrosine 
phosphorylation. The dots and error bars for each graph in panel a denote means and 
variations of ΔFnorm (n = 3 independent samples). Individual experimental data are plotted 
in Supplementary Fig. 2. c, A ‘Zip code’-like mechanism for β-Klotho dependent FGF21 
stimulation of FGFR1c. In the cell membrane of unstimulated cells β-Klotho and FGFR1c 
monomers are in equilibrium with FGFR/β-Klotho heterodimers. Due to reduced 
dimensionality, the binding of FGF21 to β-Klotho via FGF21 C-tail and bi-valent binding of 
the FGF core of FGF21 to two FGFR1c molecules will shift the equilibrium towards 
formation of a FGF21/FGFR1c/β-Klotho ternary complexes, resulting in stimulation of 
tyrosine kinase activity and cell signaling via FGFR1c. In addition, β-Klotho functions as a 
primary high affinity receptor for FGF21 and FGFR1c functions as a catalytic subunit that 
mediate receptor dimerization and intracellular signaling.
