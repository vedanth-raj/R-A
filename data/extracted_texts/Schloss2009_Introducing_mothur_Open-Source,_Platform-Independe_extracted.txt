mothur aims to be a comprehensive software package that allows users to use a single piece of software to
analyze community sequence data. It builds upon previous tools to provide a ﬂexible and powerful software
package for analyzing sequencing data. As a case study, we used mothur to trim, screen, and align sequences;
calculate distances; assign sequences to operational taxonomic units; and describe the  and  diversity of
eight marine samples previously characterized by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. This analysis
of more than 222,000 sequences was completed in less than 2 h with a laptop computer.
Since Pace and colleagues (18) outlined the culture-inde-
pendent framework for sequencing 16S rRNA gene sequences
in 1985, microbial ecologists have experienced an exponential
improvement in the ability to sequence not only this primary
phylogenetic marker but also numerous functional genes from
diverse environments. Twenty-ﬁve years later, there are over
106 rRNA gene sequences deposited in public repositories
such as GenBank and the number of sequences continues to
double every 15 to 18 months (http://www.arb-silva.de/news
/view/2009/03/27/editorial/). The development of pyrosequenc-
ing technologies has enabled the Human Microbiome Project
(29), the International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM;
http://icomm.mbl.edu), and individual investigators to collec-
tively amass over 109 16S rRNA gene sequence tags since 2006.
Because of this development in sequencing technology, indi-
vidual studies have shifted from sequencing 101 to 102 se-
quences from multiple samples (e.g., references 2 and 16) to
sequencing 104 to 105 sequences from multiple samples (e.g.,
references 27 and 28). These impressive statistics are indicative
of the excitement that the ﬁeld enjoys over relating changes in
microbial community structure with changes in ecosystem per-
formance.
Advances in computational tools have improved our ability
to address ecologically relevant questions. Because of the de-
velopment of tools including ARB (13), DOTUR (22), SONS
(23), LIBSHUFF (25, 26), UniFrac (11, 12), AMOVA and
HOMOVA (15, 21), TreeClimber (24), and rRNA-speciﬁc da-
tabases (3, 4, 20), microbial ecology has progressed from being
a descriptive to an experimental endeavor. Although these
tools have been widely successful, a number of limitations will
affect their use as sequencing capacity increases and studies
become more complex. First, for ease of use many of the
rRNA-speciﬁc databases have online tools including aligners,
classiﬁers, and analysis pipelines; however, these tools allow a
limited set of generic analyses, and we must begin to question
whether transferring gigantic data sets across the Internet for
analysis is a sustainable practice. Second, much of the existing
software was developed for analyzing 102 to 104 sequences. As
the number of sequences expands, it is essential that existing
software be refactored to use more efﬁcient algorithms. In
addition, although the use of scripting languages such as Perl
and Python has been useful for the online analysis of small data
sets, they are relatively slow compared to code written in C and
C. Finally, the boutique nature of the existing tools has
limited their integration and further development. One conse-
quence of this is that the generation of ﬁeld-wide analysis
standards has not been developed, making it difﬁcult to per-
form meta-analyses. As sequencing capacity increases and our
research questions become more sophisticated, it is critical that
the software be ﬂexible and easily maintained.
Introducing mothur. To overcome these limitations, we
have developed a single software platform, mothur (Table 1).

mothur implements the algorithms implemented in previous
tools including DOTUR, SONS, TreeClimber, LIBSHUFF,
-LIBSHUFF, and UniFrac. Beyond the implementation of
these approaches, we have incorporated additional features
including (i) over 25 calculators for quantifying key ecological
parameters for measuring  and  diversity; (ii) visualization
tools including Venn diagrams, heat maps, and dendrograms;
(iii) functions for screening sequence collections based on
quality; (iv) a NAST-based sequence aligner (5); (v) a pairwise
sequence distance calculator; and (vi) the ability to call indi-
vidual commands either from within mothur, using ﬁles with
lists of commands (i.e., batch ﬁles), or directly from the com-
mand line, providing for greater ﬂexibility in setting up analysis
pipelines.
Object oriented, responsive, free, and platform indepen-
dent. mothur is written in C using modern object-oriented
programming strategies (17, 19). Design patterns are used ex-
tensively to improve the maintenance and ﬂexibility of the
software (7). Since releasing the ﬁrst version of mothur in
February 2009, we have made use of an iterative release design
model. This means that instead of releasing mothur once a
year with many modiﬁcations, we release smaller updates to
mothur throughout the year. The advantage to this approach is
the ability to more quickly address bugs, incorporate user sug-
gestions, and get new features to users. By making mothur an
open-source software package under the GNU General Public
License (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), we have en-
sured that the software is free and open to modiﬁcation by
other investigators developing their own analysis methods.
mothur is available from the project website (http://www
.mothur.org) as a Windows-compatible executable or as source
code for compilation in Unix/Linux or Mac OS X environ-
ments.
Open documentation and support. Extensive community-
supported documentation and support are available through a
MediaWiki-based
wiki
(http://www.mediawiki.org/)
and
a
phpBB-based discussion forum (http://www.phpbb.com). The
wiki format serves two important functions. First, it is a source
of documentation that users are free to read, edit, and expand
to help themselves and others understand the theory and im-
plementation behind the commands provided in mothur. For
example, the wiki page describing each calculator includes
manual calculations. Numerous undergraduate and graduate
courses have used these example calculations to improve their
students’ numeracy. Second, users are encouraged to create
pages describing how they used the software to analyze a set of
data as a medium for teaching others the diverse ways that one
can design experiments and analyze their data. These “exam-
ple workﬂows” include the original data, commands, and com-
mentary from unpublished and published studies (e.g., refer-
ences 1, 8, and 9). The discussion forum allows users to ask
questions that anyone can answer, and the forum allows users
to suggest improvements to the software.
Example workﬂow: the ocean’s rare biosphere. Although
mothur is fully capable of analyzing traditional clone-based
sequences, here we demonstrate the ability of mothur to efﬁ-
ciently analyze a pyrosequencing data set. Sogin and col-
leagues, in a seminal 2006 study that outlined the use of pyro-
sequencing in microbial ecology studies, obtained 216,243
high-quality sequence reads from the V6 region of the 16S
rRNA gene from eight samples (27). They obtained six-paired
samples from the meso- and bathypelagic realms from three
sites in the North Atlantic Deep Water loop and two samples
from diffuse hydrothermal vent ﬂuids near the site of an erup-
tion in the Axial Seamount in the northeast Paciﬁc Ocean (Fig.
1). Their analysis primarily considered their inability to exhaus-

tively sample the biodiversity of sites in spite of record sequenc-
ing depths. The sequence data were obtained from http://jbpc.mbl
.edu/research_supplements/g454/20060412-private/, and we used
the 2 February 2008 version of the data set. These data differ
from those described in the original publication because the
data processing algorithms internal to the GS20 machine were
updated; therefore, it is not possible to make a direct compar-
ison to the ﬁndings of the original analysis. Although these
data were already trimmed and sorted into individual ﬁles for
each sample, mothur has the capacity to generate these ﬁles
from the FASTA-formatted sequence ﬁle generated by a se-
quencer. Furthermore, mothur has a number of functions for
performing hypothesis tests, but here we will focus on opera-
tional taxonomic unit (OTU)-based methods of describing and
comparing communities.
mothur makes several improvements that allow users with
modest computing resources to analyze large data sets. Most
signiﬁcant are the ability to analyze only the unique sequences
in a data set but retain information about the number of times
that each sequence was observed and the use of sparse matri-
ces that represent only distances smaller than a user-speciﬁed
cutoff. Using a PHYLIP-based approach would have required
approximately 145 GB to represent 2.3  1010 distances. Our
improvements resulted in an 18.9-MB ﬁle containing 5.2  105
pairwise distances that were smaller than 0.10. The only
mothur-imposed limit is the number of distances that can be
processed, which is 264. The more likely limitation will be the
amount of random-access memory (RAM) available on the
user’s computer. With the reduced memory requirement also
comes signiﬁcantly improved processing speed. Considering
that most computers have multiple processors, users can obtain
further increases in speed by utilizing the parallelization fea-
tures provided in the alignment and distance calculation com-
mands.
mothur can cluster sequences using the furthest neighbor,
nearest neighbor, or UPGMA (unweighted-pair group method
using average linkages) algorithms (22). The ability to let the
data speak for themselves in determining OTUs is advanta-
geous compared to database-based approaches that can form
clusters, in which sequences are similar to the same database
sequences but not to each other. Furthermore, mothur uses the
approach employed in DOTUR where OTUs are deﬁned for
multiple cutoffs up to the distance threshold so that alternative
OTU deﬁnitions can be compared. For example, using the
furthest neighbor algorithm, we clustered sequences into
OTUs up to a distance threshold of 0.10 and observed 13,202,
11,317, and 7,971 OTUs at cutoffs of 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10 dis-
tance units, respectively. A similar type of analysis using the
approach used in programs such as CD-HIT would limit the
user to a nearest neighbor-based approach, and the users
would need to run the program for each distance level in which
they were interested (10).
By inputting a ﬁle that maps each sequence to a sample
identiﬁer, the clusters could be parsed to perform -diversity
analyses. First, we calculated the richness and diversity of the
eight samples at OTU cutoffs of 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10 distance
units by using the number of observed OTUs, Chao1 estimated
minimum number of OTUs, and a nonparametric Shannon
diversity index (Table 2). Second, we calculated rarefaction
curves for the eight samples for a 0.10 distance cutoff (Fig. 2);
the original Sogin analysis built rarefaction curves using fre-
quencies acquired from a database-based OTU assignment
analysis. Interestingly, mothur calculated the coverage of these
samples to be between 0.94 and 0.98, and yet the rarefaction
curves continued to climb with increasing sequencing effort.
These types of analysis were the extent of the -diversity mea-
surements performed in the original Sogin analysis, and each
sample required up to 4 days to complete on a Quad Opteron
875 2.2-GHz series Dual Core machine with 28 GB of RAM
(S. Huse, personal communication). The analysis described in
this paper—from aligning of sequences through -diversity
analyses—required less than 2 h with use of a MacBook Pro
laptop with 2 GB RAM and with only one of the 2.0-GHz dual
processors.
Due to software limitations, it was not possible to assess the
 diversity of the samples in the original Sogin analysis. With
the software improvements implemented in mothur, we were
able to transform the original OTU information into heat

the samples based on the membership-based Jaccard coefﬁcient calculated using Chao1 estimated richness values. The dendrogram on the right

maps, Venn diagrams, and dendrograms (Fig. 1) to describe
the similarities in membership and structure of the eight sam-
ples. Several interesting observations can be made from this
analysis. First, although the dendrograms generated using the
Jaccard coefﬁcient and the YC community structure similarity
coefﬁcient have similar topologies, the terminal branch lengths
of the Jaccard coefﬁcient dendrogram are considerably longer
for samples 53R, 55R, 115R, and 137. This is interesting be-
cause it indicates that while these samples have considerably
different memberships (Jaccard), the relative abundances
of the shared OTUs are similar. Thus, the differences between
the communities are likely found in the rarer OTUs. Second,
the two diffuse hydrothermal ﬂow samples clearly cluster away
from the others. This is intuitive because of the considerable
differences in temperature and chemistry. Third, the only avail-
able piece of metadata that explains the clustering of the sea-
water samples is extreme depth; the deepest sample, 112R,
clearly clusters away from the other seawater samples and was
taken 2,411 m deeper than was any of the other samples.
Considering that this was the only sample taken at such an
extreme depth, additional sampling is required in order to have
conﬁdence in such a correlation.
Looking forward. The development of computational tools
to describe and analyze microbial communities is in a “Red
Queen”-type race where advances in computational power are
met with expansions in sequencing capacity and vice versa. As
the length and number of reads multiply, data analysis re-
sources must meet the challenge. Although mothur goes a long
way toward making data analysis efﬁcient, ﬂexible, and simple,
the analyses are by no means trivial, and researchers must take
care to ensure that their experiments are well designed and
thought out and that their results are biologically plausible.
The ﬁeld of microbial ecology is experiencing an amazing rev-
olution where we can now design experiments with sophisti-
cated experimental designs. Tools such as mothur open new
possibilities so that the primary limitation is our imagination.
Funding for mothur has been provided by the College of Natural
Resources and the Environment at the University of Massachusetts, a
grant from the Sloan Foundation, a grant from the National Science
Foundation (award 0743432), and the Austrian GEN-AU project BIN.
We appreciate the input and support of the more than 900 users who
