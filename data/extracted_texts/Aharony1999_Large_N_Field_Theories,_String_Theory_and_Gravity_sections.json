      "content": "1.1\nGeneral Introduction and Overview\nThe microscopic description of nature as presently understood and veri\ufb01ed by experi-\nment involves quantum \ufb01eld theories. All particles are excitations of some \ufb01eld. These\nparticles are pointlike and they interact locally with other particles.\nEven though\nquantum \ufb01eld theories describe nature at the distance scales we observe, there are\nstrong indications that new elements will be involved at very short distances (or very\nhigh energies), distances of the order of the Planck scale. The reason is that at those\ndistances (or energies) quantum gravity e\ufb00ects become important. It has not been\npossible to quantize gravity following the usual perturbative methods. Nevertheless,\none can incorporate quantum gravity in a consistent quantum theory by giving up the\nnotion that particles are pointlike and assuming that the fundamental objects in the\ntheory are strings, namely one-dimensional extended objects [1, 2]. These strings can\noscillate, and there is a spectrum of energies, or masses, for these oscillating strings.\nThe oscillating strings look like localized, particle-like excitations to a low energy ob-\nserver. So, a single oscillating string can e\ufb00ectively give rise to many types of particles,\ndepending on its state of oscillation. All string theories include a particle with zero\nmass and spin two. Strings can interact by splitting and joining interactions. The only\nconsistent interaction for massless spin two particles is that of gravity. Therefore, any\nstring theory will contain gravity. The structure of string theory is highly constrained.\nString theories do not make sense in an arbitrary number of dimensions or on any\narbitrary geometry. Flat space string theory exists (at least in perturbation theory)\nonly in ten dimensions. Actually, 10-dimensional string theory is described by a string\nwhich also has fermionic excitations and gives rise to a supersymmetric theory.1 String\ntheory is then a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. One can get down to four\n1One could consider a string with no fermionic excitations, the so called \u201cbosonic\u201d string. It lives\nin 26 dimensions and contains tachyons, signaling an instability of the theory.\n4\n\n\ndimensions by considering string theory on R4 \u00d7 M6 where M6 is some six dimensional\ncompact manifold. Then, low energy interactions are determined by the geometry of\nM6.\nEven though this is the motivation usually given for string theory nowadays, it is\nnot how string theory was originally discovered. String theory was discovered in an\nattempt to describe the large number of mesons and hadrons that were experimentally\ndiscovered in the 1960\u2019s. The idea was to view all these particles as di\ufb00erent oscillation\nmodes of a string. The string idea described well some features of the hadron spectrum.\nFor example, the mass of the lightest hadron with a given spin obeys a relation like\nm2 \u223cTJ2 + const. This is explained simply by assuming that the mass and angular\nmomentum come from a rotating, relativistic string of tension T. It was later discovered\nthat hadrons and mesons are actually made of quarks and that they are described by\nQCD.\nQCD is a gauge theory based on the group SU(3). This is sometimes stated by saying\nthat quarks have three colors. QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that the e\ufb00ective\ncoupling constant decreases as the energy increases. At low energies QCD becomes\nstrongly coupled and it is not easy to perform calculations. One possible approach\nis to use numerical simulations on the lattice. This is at present the best available\ntool to do calculations in QCD at low energies. It was suggested by \u2019t Hooft that the\ntheory might simplify when the number of colors N is large [3]. The hope was that one\ncould solve exactly the theory with N = \u221e, and then one could do an expansion in\n1/N = 1/3. Furthermore, as explained in the next section, the diagrammatic expansion\nof the \ufb01eld theory suggests that the large N theory is a free string theory and that\nthe string coupling constant is 1/N. If the case with N = 3 is similar to the case\nwith N = \u221ethen this explains why the string model gave the correct relation between\nthe mass and the angular momentum. In this way the large N limit connects gauge\ntheories with string theories. The \u2019t Hooft argument, reviewed below, is very general,\nso it suggests that di\ufb00erent kinds of gauge theories will correspond to di\ufb00erent string\ntheories. In this review we will study this correspondence between string theories and\nthe large N limit of \ufb01eld theories. We will see that the strings arising in the large N\nlimit of \ufb01eld theories are the same as the strings describing quantum gravity. Namely,\nstring theory in some backgrounds, including quantum gravity, is equivalent (dual) to\na \ufb01eld theory.\nWe said above that strings are not consistent in four \ufb02at dimensions. Indeed, if one\nwants to quantize a four dimensional string theory an anomaly appears that forces the\nintroduction of an extra \ufb01eld, sometimes called the \u201cLiouville\u201d \ufb01eld [4]. This \ufb01eld on\nthe string worldsheet may be interpreted as an extra dimension, so that the strings\ne\ufb00ectively move in \ufb01ve dimensions. One might qualitatively think of this new \ufb01eld as\nthe \u201cthickness\u201d of the string. If this is the case, why do we say that the string moves\n5\n\n\nin \ufb01ve dimensions? The reason is that, like any string theory, this theory will contain\ngravity, and the gravitational theory will live in as many dimensions as the number of\n\ufb01elds we have on the string. It is crucial then that the \ufb01ve dimensional geometry is\ncurved, so that it can correspond to a four dimensional \ufb01eld theory, as described in\ndetail below.\nThe argument that gauge theories are related to string theories in the large N limit\nis very general and is valid for basically any gauge theory.\nIn particular we could\nconsider a gauge theory where the coupling does not run (as a function of the energy\nscale). Then, the theory is conformally invariant. It is quite hard to \ufb01nd quantum \ufb01eld\ntheories that are conformally invariant. In supersymmetric theories it is sometimes\npossible to prove exact conformal invariance. A simple example, which will be the\nmain example in this review, is the supersymmetric SU(N) (or U(N)) gauge theory in\nfour dimensions with four spinor supercharges (N = 4). Four is the maximal possible\nnumber of supercharges for a \ufb01eld theory in four dimensions. Besides the gauge \ufb01elds\n(gluons) this theory contains also four fermions and six scalar \ufb01elds in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the gauge group.\nThe Lagrangian of such theories is completely\ndetermined by supersymmetry. There is a global SU(4) R-symmetry that rotates the\nsix scalar \ufb01elds and the four fermions.\nThe conformal group in four dimensions is\nSO(4, 2), including the usual Poincar\u00b4e transformations as well as scale transformations\nand special conformal transformations (which include the inversion symmetry x\u00b5 \u2192\nx\u00b5/x2). These symmetries of the \ufb01eld theory should be re\ufb02ected in the dual string\ntheory. The simplest way for this to happen is if the \ufb01ve dimensional geometry has these\nsymmetries. Locally there is only one space with SO(4, 2) isometries: \ufb01ve dimensional\nAnti-de-Sitter space, or AdS5. Anti-de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric solution\nof Einstein\u2019s equations with a negative cosmological constant. In this supersymmetric\ncase we expect the strings to also be supersymmetric. We said that superstrings move\nin ten dimensions. Now that we have added one more dimension it is not surprising any\nmore to add \ufb01ve more to get to a ten dimensional space. Since the gauge theory has\nan SU(4) \u2243SO(6) global symmetry it is rather natural that the extra \ufb01ve dimensional\nspace should be a \ufb01ve sphere, S5. So, we conclude that N = 4 U(N) Yang-Mills theory\ncould be the same as ten dimensional superstring theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 [5]. Here we\nhave presented a very heuristic argument for this equivalence; later we will be more\nprecise and give more evidence for this correspondence.\nThe relationship we described between gauge theories and string theory on Anti-de-\nSitter spaces was motivated by studies of D-branes and black holes in strings theory.\nD-branes are solitons in string theory [6]. They come in various dimensionalities. If\nthey have zero spatial dimensions they are like ordinary localized, particle-type soliton\nsolutions, analogous to the \u2019t Hooft-Polyakov [7, 8] monopole in gauge theories. These\nare called D-zero-branes. If they have one extended dimension they are called D-one-\n6\n\n\nbranes or D-strings. They are much heavier than ordinary fundamental strings when\nthe string coupling is small. In fact, the tension of all D-branes is proportional to 1/gs,\nwhere gs is the string coupling constant. D-branes are de\ufb01ned in string perturbation\ntheory in a very simple way: they are surfaces where open strings can end. These\nopen strings have some massless modes, which describe the oscillations of the branes,\na gauge \ufb01eld living on the brane, and their fermionic partners. If we have N coincident\nbranes the open strings can start and end on di\ufb00erent branes, so they carry two indices\nthat run from one to N. This in turn implies that the low energy dynamics is described\nby a U(N) gauge theory. D-p-branes are charged under p + 1-form gauge potentials,\nin the same way that a 0-brane (particle) can be charged under a one-form gauge\npotential (as in electromagnetism). These p + 1-form gauge potentials have p + 2-form\n\ufb01eld strengths, and they are part of the massless closed string modes, which belong to\nthe supergravity (SUGRA) multiplet containing the massless \ufb01elds in \ufb02at space string\ntheory (before we put in any D-branes). If we now add D-branes they generate a \ufb02ux of\nthe corresponding \ufb01eld strength, and this \ufb02ux in turn contributes to the stress energy\ntensor so the geometry becomes curved. Indeed it is possible to \ufb01nd solutions of the\nsupergravity equations carrying these \ufb02uxes. Supergravity is the low-energy limit of\nstring theory, and it is believed that these solutions may be extended to solutions of\nthe full string theory. These solutions are very similar to extremal charged black hole\nsolutions in general relativity, except that in this case they are black branes with p\nextended spatial dimensions. Like black holes they contain event horizons.\nIf we consider a set of N coincident D-3-branes the near horizon geometry turns out\nto be AdS5 \u00d7S5. On the other hand, the low energy dynamics on their worldvolume is\ngoverned by a U(N) gauge theory with N = 4 supersymmetry [9]. These two pictures of\nD-branes are perturbatively valid for di\ufb00erent regimes in the space of possible coupling\nconstants. Perturbative \ufb01eld theory is valid when gsN is small, while the low-energy\ngravitational description is perturbatively valid when the radius of curvature is much\nlarger than the string scale, which turns out to imply that gsN should be very large. As\nan object is brought closer and closer to the black brane horizon its energy measured\nby an outside observer is redshifted, due to the large gravitational potential, and the\nenergy seems to be very small.\nOn the other hand low energy excitations on the\nbranes are governed by the Yang-Mills theory. So, it becomes natural to conjecture\nthat Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling is describing the near horizon region of\nthe black brane, whose geometry is AdS5 \u00d7 S5. The \ufb01rst indications that this is the\ncase came from calculations of low energy graviton absorption cross sections [10, 11,\n12]. It was noticed there that the calculation done using gravity and the calculation\ndone using super Yang-Mills theory agreed. These calculations, in turn, were inspired\nby similar calculations for coincident D1-D5 branes.\nIn this case the near horizon\ngeometry involves AdS3 \u00d7 S3 and the low energy \ufb01eld theory living on the D-branes\n7\n\n\nis a 1+1 dimensional conformal \ufb01eld theory. In this D1-D5 case there were numerous\ncalculations that agreed between the \ufb01eld theory and gravity. First black hole entropy\nfor extremal black holes was calculated in terms of the \ufb01eld theory in [13], and then\nagreement was shown for near extremal black holes [14, 15] and for absorption cross\nsections [16, 17, 18]. More generally, we will see that correlation functions in the gauge\ntheory can be calculated using the string theory (or gravity for large gsN) description,\nby considering the propagation of particles between di\ufb00erent points in the boundary\nof AdS, the points where operators are inserted [19, 20].\nSupergravities on AdS spaces were studied very extensively, see [21, 22] for reviews.\nSee also [23, 24] for earlier hints of the correspondence.\nOne of the main points of this review will be that the strings coming from gauge\ntheories are very much like the ordinary superstrings that have been studied during the\nlast 20 years. The only particular feature is that they are moving on a curved geometry\n(anti-de Sitter space) which has a boundary at spatial in\ufb01nity. The boundary is at an\nin\ufb01nite spatial distance, but a light ray can go to the boundary and come back in \ufb01nite\ntime. Massive particles can never get to the boundary. The radius of curvature of\nAnti-de Sitter space depends on N so that large N corresponds to a large radius of\ncurvature. Thus, by taking N to be large we can make the curvature as small as we\nwant. The theory in AdS includes gravity, since any string theory includes gravity. So\nin the end we claim that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory and a\n\ufb01eld theory. However, the mapping between the gravitational and \ufb01eld theory degrees\nof freedom is quite non-trivial since the \ufb01eld theory lives in a lower dimension. In some\nsense the \ufb01eld theory (or at least the set of local observables in the \ufb01eld theory) lives\non the boundary of spacetime. One could argue that in general any quantum gravity\ntheory in AdS de\ufb01nes a conformal \ufb01eld theory (CFT) \u201con the boundary\u201d. In some\nsense the situation is similar to the correspondence between three dimensional Chern-\nSimons theory and a WZW model on the boundary [25]. This is a topological theory in\nthree dimensions that induces a normal (non-topological) \ufb01eld theory on the boundary.\nA theory which includes gravity is in some sense topological since one is integrating\nover all metrics and therefore the theory does not depend on the metric. Similarly,\nin a quantum gravity theory we do not have any local observables. Notice that when\nwe say that the theory includes \u201cgravity on AdS\u201d we are considering any \ufb01nite energy\nexcitation, even black holes in AdS. So this is really a sum over all spacetimes that are\nasymptotic to AdS at the boundary. This is analogous to the usual \ufb02at space discussion\nof quantum gravity, where asymptotic \ufb02atness is required, but the spacetime could have\nany topology as long as it is asymptotically \ufb02at. The asymptotically AdS case as well\nas the asymptotically \ufb02at cases are special in the sense that one can choose a natural\ntime and an associated Hamiltonian to de\ufb01ne the quantum theory. Since black holes\nmight be present this time coordinate is not necessarily globally well-de\ufb01ned, but it is\n8\n\n\ncertainly well-de\ufb01ned at in\ufb01nity. If we assume that the conjecture we made above is\nvalid, then the U(N) Yang-Mills theory gives a non-perturbative de\ufb01nition of string\ntheory on AdS. And, by taking the limit N \u2192\u221e, we can extract the (ten dimensional\nstring theory) \ufb02at space physics, a procedure which is in principle (but not in detail)\nsimilar to the one used in matrix theory [26].\nThe fact that the \ufb01eld theory lives in a lower dimensional space blends in perfectly\nwith some previous speculations about quantum gravity.\nIt was suggested [27, 28]\nthat quantum gravity theories should be holographic, in the sense that physics in some\nregion can be described by a theory at the boundary with no more than one degree of\nfreedom per Planck area. This \u201cholographic\u201d principle comes from thinking about the\nBekenstein bound which states that the maximum amount of entropy in some region\nis given by the area of the region in Planck units [29]. The reason for this bound is\nthat otherwise black hole formation could violate the second law of thermodynamics.\nWe will see that the correspondence between \ufb01eld theories and string theory on AdS\nspace (including gravity) is a concrete realization of this holographic principle.\nThe review is organized as follows.\nIn the rest of the introductory chapter, we present background material. In section\n1.2, we present the \u2019t Hooft large N limit and its indication that gauge theories may\nbe dual to string theories. In section 1.3, we review the p-brane supergravity solutions.\nWe discuss D-branes, their worldvolume theory and their relation to the p-branes. We\ndiscuss greybody factors and their calculation for black holes built out of D-branes.\nIn chapter 2, we review conformal \ufb01eld theories and AdS spaces. In section 2.1, we\ngive a brief description of conformal \ufb01eld theories. In section 2.2, we summarize the\ngeometry of AdS spaces and gauged supergravities.\nIn chapter 3, we \u201cderive\u201d the correspondence between supersymmetric Yang Mills\ntheory and string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 from the physics of D3-branes in string the-\nory. We de\ufb01ne, in section 3.1, the correspondence between \ufb01elds in the string theory\nand operators of the conformal \ufb01eld theory and the prescription for the computation\nof correlation functions. We also point out that the correspondence gives an explicit\nholographic description of gravity. In section 3.2, we review the direct tests of the dual-\nity, including matching the spectrum of chiral primary operators and some correlation\nfunctions and anomalies. Computation of correlation functions is reviewed in section\n3.3. The isomorphism of the Hilbert spaces of string theory on AdS spaces and of\nCFTs is decribed in section 3.4. We describe how to introduce Wilson loop operators\nin section 3.5. In section 3.6, we analyze \ufb01nite temperature theories and the thermal\nphase transition.\nIn chapter 4, we review other topics involving AdS5. In section 4.1, we consider\nsome other gauge theories that arise from D-branes at orbifolds, orientifolds, or conifold\npoints. In section 4.2, we review how baryons and instantons arise in the string theory\n9\n\n\ndescription. In section 4.3, we study some deformations of the CFT and how they arise\nin the string theory description.\nIn chapter 5, we describe a similar correspondence involving 1+1 dimensional CFTs\nand AdS3 spaces. We also describe the relation of these results to black holes in \ufb01ve\ndimensions.\nIn chapter 6, we consider other examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence as well as\nnon conformal and non supersymmetric cases. In section 6.1, we analyse the M2 and M5\nbranes theories, and go on to describe situations that are not conformal, realized on the\nworldvolume of various Dp-branes, and the \u201clittle string theories\u201d on the worldvolume\nof NS 5-branes.\nIn section 6.2, we describe an approach to studying theories that\nare con\ufb01ning and have a behavior similar to QCD in three and four dimensions. We\ndiscuss con\ufb01nement, \u03b8-vacua, the mass spectrum and other dynamical aspects of these\ntheories.\nFinally, the last chapter is devoted to a summary and discussion.\nOther reviews of this subject are [30, 31, 32, 33].\n1.2\nLarge N Gauge Theories as String Theories\nThe relation between gauge theories and string theories has been an interesting topic\nof research for over three decades. String theory was originally developed as a theory\nfor the strong interactions, due to various string-like aspects of the strong interactions,\nsuch as con\ufb01nement and Regge behavior. It was later realized that there is another\ndescription of the strong interactions, in terms of an SU(3) gauge theory (QCD), which\nis consistent with all experimental data to date. However, while the gauge theory de-\nscription is very useful for studying the high-energy behavior of the strong interactions,\nit is very di\ufb03cult to use it to study low-energy issues such as con\ufb01nement and chiral\nsymmetry breaking (the only current method for addressing these issues in the full\nnon-Abelian gauge theory is by numerical simulations). In the last few years many\nexamples of the phenomenon generally known as \u201cduality\u201d have been discovered, in\nwhich a single theory has (at least) two di\ufb00erent descriptions, such that when one\ndescription is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice versa (examples of\nthis phenomenon in two dimensional \ufb01eld theories have been known for many years).\nOne could hope that a similar phenomenon would apply in the theory of the strong\ninteractions, and that a \u201cdual\u201d description of QCD exists which would be more ap-\npropriate for studying the low-energy regime where the gauge theory description is\nstrongly coupled.\nThere are several indications that this \u201cdual\u201d description could be a string the-\nory. QCD has in it string-like objects which are the \ufb02ux tubes or Wilson lines. If\n10\n\n\nwe try to separate a quark from an anti-quark, a \ufb02ux tube forms between them (if\n\u03c8 is a quark \ufb01eld, the operator \u00af\u03c8(0)\u03c8(x) is not gauge-invariant but the operator\n\u00af\u03c8(0)P exp(i\nR x\n0 A\u00b5dx\u00b5)\u03c8(x) is gauge-invariant).\nIn many ways these \ufb02ux tubes be-\nhave like strings, and there have been many attempts to write down a string theory\ndescribing the strong interactions in which the \ufb02ux tubes are the basic objects. It\nis clear that such a stringy description would have many desirable phenomenological\nattributes since, after all, this is how string theory was originally discovered. The most\ndirect indication from the gauge theory that it could be described in terms of a string\ntheory comes from the \u2019t Hooft large N limit [3], which we will now describe in detail.\nYang-Mills (YM) theories in four dimensions have no dimensionless parameters, since\nthe gauge coupling is dimensionally transmuted into the QCD scale \u039bQCD (which is the\nonly mass scale in these theories). Thus, there is no obvious perturbation expansion\nthat can be performed to learn about the physics near the scale \u039bQCD. However, an\nadditional parameter of SU(N) gauge theories is the integer number N, and one may\nhope that the gauge theories may simplify at large N (despite the larger number of\ndegrees of freedom), and have a perturbation expansion in terms of the parameter 1/N.\nThis turns out to be true, as shown by \u2019t Hooft based on the following analysis (reviews\nof large N QCD may be found in [34, 35]).\nFirst, we need to understand how to scale the coupling gY M as we take N \u2192\u221e.\nIn an asymptotically free theory, like pure YM theory, it is natural to scale gY M so\nthat \u039bQCD remains constant in the large N limit. The beta function equation for pure\nSU(N) YM theory is\n\u00b5dgY M\nd\u00b5\n= \u221211\n3 N g3\nY M\n16\u03c02 + O(g5\nY M),\n(1.1)\nso the leading terms are of the same order for large N if we take N \u2192\u221ewhile keeping\n\u03bb \u2261g2\nY MN \ufb01xed (one can show that the higher order terms are also of the same order\nin this limit). This is known as the \u2019t Hooft limit. The same behavior is valid if we\ninclude also matter \ufb01elds (fermions or scalars) in the adjoint representation, as long as\nthe theory is still asymptotically free. If the theory is conformal, such as the N = 4\nSYM theory which we will discuss in detail below, it is not obvious that the limit of\nconstant \u03bb is the only one that makes sense, and indeed we will see that other limits, in\nwhich \u03bb \u2192\u221e, are also possible. However, the limit of constant \u03bb is still a particularly\ninteresting limit and we will focus on it in the remainder of this chapter.\nInstead of focusing just on the YM theory, let us describe a general theory which\nhas some \ufb01elds \u03a6a\ni , where a is an index in the adjoint representation of SU(N), and i\nis some label of the \ufb01eld (a spin index, a \ufb02avor index, etc.). Some of these \ufb01elds can\nbe ghost \ufb01elds (as will be the case in gauge theory). We will assume that as in the\nYM theory (and in the N = 4 SYM theory), the 3-point vertices of all these \ufb01elds are\nproportional to gY M, and the 4-point functions to g2\nY M, so the Lagrangian is of the\n11\n\n\nschematic form\nL \u223cTr(d\u03a6id\u03a6i) + gY McijkTr(\u03a6i\u03a6j\u03a6k) + g2\nY MdijklTr(\u03a6i\u03a6j\u03a6k\u03a6l),\n(1.2)\nfor some constants cijk and dijkl (where we have assumed that the interactions are\nSU(N)-invariant; mass terms can also be added and do not change the analysis).\nRescaling the \ufb01elds by \u02dc\u03a6i \u2261gY M\u03a6i, the Lagrangian becomes\nL \u223c\n1\ng2\nY M\nh\nTr(d\u02dc\u03a6id\u02dc\u03a6i) + cijkTr(\u02dc\u03a6i \u02dc\u03a6j \u02dc\u03a6k) + dijklTr(\u02dc\u03a6i \u02dc\u03a6j \u02dc\u03a6k \u02dc\u03a6l)\ni\n,\n(1.3)\nwith a coe\ufb03cient of 1/g2\nY M = N/\u03bb in front of the whole Lagrangian.\nNow, we can ask what happens to correlation functions in the limit of large N\nwith constant \u03bb. Naively, this is a classical limit since the coe\ufb03cient in front of the\nLagrangian diverges, but in fact this is not true since the number of components in\nthe \ufb01elds also goes to in\ufb01nity in this limit. We can write the Feynman diagrams of\nthe theory (1.3) in a double line notation, in which an adjoint \ufb01eld \u03a6a is represented\nas a direct product of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental \ufb01eld, \u03a6i\nj, as in \ufb01gure\n1.1. The interaction vertices we wrote are all consistent with this sort of notation. The\npropagators are also consistent with it in a U(N) theory; in an SU(N) theory there is\na small mixing term\nD\n\u03a6i\nj\u03a6k\nl\nE\n\u221d(\u03b4i\nl\u03b4j\nk \u22121\nN \u03b4i\nj\u03b4k\nl ),\n(1.4)\nwhich makes the expansion slightly more complicated, but this involves only subleading\nterms in the large N limit so we will neglect this di\ufb00erence here. Ignoring the second\nterm the propagator for the adjoint \ufb01eld is (in terms of the index structure) like that of a\nfundamental-anti-fundamental pair. Thus, any Feynman diagram of adjoint \ufb01elds may\nbe viewed as a network of double lines. Let us begin by analyzing vacuum diagrams\n(the generalization to adding external \ufb01elds is simple and will be discussed below). In\nsuch a diagram we can view these double lines as forming the edges in a simplicial\ndecomposition (for example, it could be a triangulation) of a surface, if we view each\nsingle-line loop as the perimeter of a face of the simplicial decomposition. The resulting\nsurface will be oriented since the lines have an orientation (in one direction for a\nfundamental index and in the opposite direction for an anti-fundamental index). When\nwe compactify space by adding a point at in\ufb01nity, each diagram thus corresponds to a\ncompact, closed, oriented surface.\nWhat is the power of N and \u03bb associated with such a diagram? From the form\nof (1.3) it is clear that each vertex carries a coe\ufb03cient proportional to N/\u03bb, while\npropagators are proportional to \u03bb/N. Additional powers of N come from the sum over\nthe indices in the loops, which gives a factor of N for each loop in the diagram (since\neach index has N possible values). Thus, we \ufb01nd that a diagram with V vertices, E\n12\n\n\n2\nN\nN\n0\nFigure 1.1: Some diagrams in a \ufb01eld theory with adjoint \ufb01elds in the standard repre-\nsentation (on the left) and in the double line representation (on the right). The dashed\nlines are propagators for the adjoint \ufb01elds, the small circles represent interaction ver-\ntices, and solid lines carry indices in the fundamental representation.\npropagators (= edges in the simplicial decomposition) and F loops (= faces in the\nsimplicial decomposition) comes with a coe\ufb03cient proportional to\nNV \u2212E+F\u03bbE\u2212V = N\u03c7\u03bbE\u2212V ,\n(1.5)\nwhere \u03c7 \u2261V \u2212E+F is the Euler character of the surface corresponding to the diagram.\nFor closed oriented surfaces, \u03c7 = 2 \u22122g where g is the genus (the number of handles)\nof the surface.2 Thus, the perturbative expansion of any diagram in the \ufb01eld theory\nmay be written as a double expansion of the form\n\u221e\nX\ng=0\nN2\u22122g\n\u221e\nX\ni=0\ncg,i\u03bbi =\n\u221e\nX\ng=0\nN2\u22122gfg(\u03bb),\n(1.6)\nwhere fg is some polynomial in \u03bb (in an asymptotically free theory the \u03bb-dependence\nwill turn into some \u039bQCD-dependence but the general form is similar; infrared diver-\ngences could also lead to the appearance of terms which are not integer powers of \u03bb).\nIn the large N limit we see that any computation will be dominated by the surfaces\nof maximal \u03c7 or minimal genus, which are surfaces with the topology of a sphere (or\n2We are discussing here only connected diagrams, for disconnected diagrams we have similar con-\ntributions from each connected component.\n13\n\n\nequivalently a plane). All these planar diagrams will give a contribution of order N2,\nwhile all other diagrams will be suppressed by powers of 1/N2. For example, the \ufb01rst\ndiagram in \ufb01gure 1.1 is planar and proportional to N2\u22123+3 = N2, while the second one\nis not and is proportional to N4\u22126+2 = N0. We presented our analysis for a general\ntheory, but in particular it is true for any gauge theory coupled to adjoint matter \ufb01elds,\nlike the N = 4 SYM theory. The rest of our discussion will be limited mostly to gauge\ntheories, where only gauge-invariant (SU(N)-invariant) objects are usually of interest.\nThe form of the expansion (1.6) is the same as one \ufb01nds in a perturbative theory\nwith closed oriented strings, if we identify 1/N as the string coupling constant3. Of\ncourse, we do not really see any strings in the expansion, but just diagrams with holes\nin them; however, one can hope that in a full non-perturbative description of the \ufb01eld\ntheory the holes will \u201cclose\u201d and the surfaces of the Feynman diagrams will become\nactual closed surfaces. The analogy of (1.6) with perturbative string theory is one\nof the strongest motivations for believing that \ufb01eld theories and string theories are\nrelated, and it suggests that this relation would be more visible in the large N limit\nwhere the dual string theory may be weakly coupled.\nHowever, since the analysis\nwas based on perturbation theory which generally does not converge, it is far from a\nrigorous derivation of such a relation, but rather an indication that it might apply,\nat least for some \ufb01eld theories (there are certainly also e\ufb00ects like instantons which\nare non-perturbative in the 1/N expansion, and an exact matching with string theory\nwould require a matching of such e\ufb00ects with non-perturbative e\ufb00ects in string theory).\nThe fact that 1/N behaves as a coupling constant in the large N limit can also be\nseen directly in the \ufb01eld theory analysis of the \u2019t Hooft limit. While we have derived the\nbehavior (1.6) only for vacuum diagrams, it actually holds for any correlation function\nof a product of gauge-invariant \ufb01elds\nDQn\nj=1 Gj\nE\nsuch that each Gj cannot be written as\na product of two gauge-invariant \ufb01elds (for instance, Gj can be of the form 1\nN Tr(Q\ni \u03a6i)).\nWe can study such a correlation function by adding to the action S \u2192S + N P gjGj,\nand then, if W is the sum of connected vacuum diagrams we discussed above (but now\ncomputed with the new action),\n* n\nY\nj=1\nGj\n+\n= (iN)\u2212n\n\"\n\u2202nW\nQn\nj=1 \u2202gj\n#\ngj=0\n.\n(1.7)\nOur analysis of the vacuum diagrams above holds also for these diagrams, since we\nput in additional vertices with a factor of N, and, in the double line representation,\neach of the operators we inserted becomes a vertex of the simplicial decomposition\nof the surface (this would not be true for operators which are themselves products,\n3In the conformal case, where \u03bb is a free parameter, there is actually a freedom of choosing the\nstring coupling constant to be 1/N times any function of \u03bb without changing the form of the expansion,\nand this will be used below.\n14\n\n\nand which would correspond to more than one vertex). Thus, the leading contribution\nto\nDQn\nj=1 Gj\nE\nwill come from planar diagrams with n additional operator insertions,\nleading to\n* n\nY\nj=1\nGj\n+\n\u221dN2\u2212n\n(1.8)\nin the \u2019t Hooft limit. We see that (in terms of powers of N) the 2-point functions of the\nGj\u2019s come out to be canonically normalized, while 3-point functions are proportional\nto 1/N, so indeed 1/N is the coupling constant in this limit (higher genus diagrams\ndo not a\ufb00ect this conclusion since they just add higher order terms in 1/N). In the\nstring theory analogy the operators Gj would become vertex operators inserted on the\nstring world-sheet. For asymptotically free con\ufb01ning theories (like QCD) one can show\nthat in the large N limit they have an in\ufb01nite spectrum of stable particles with rising\nmasses (as expected in a free string theory). Many additional properties of the large\nN limit are discussed in [36, 34] and other references.\nThe analysis we did of the \u2019t Hooft limit for SU(N) theories with adjoint \ufb01elds\ncan easily be generalized to other cases. Matter in the fundamental representation\nappears as single-line propagators in the diagrams, which correspond to boundaries of\nthe corresponding surfaces. Thus, if we have such matter we need to sum also over\nsurfaces with boundaries, as in open string theories. For SO(N) or USp(N) gauge\ntheories we can represent the adjoint representation as a product of two fundamental\nrepresentations (instead of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental representation),\nand the fundamental representation is real, so no arrows appear on the propagators in\nthe diagram, and the resulting surfaces may be non-orientable. Thus, these theories\nseem to be related to non-orientable string theories [37]. We will not discuss these cases\nin detail here, some of the relevant aspects will be discussed in section 4.1.2 below.\nOur analysis thus far indicates that gauge theories may be dual to string theories\nwith a coupling proportional to 1/N in the \u2019t Hooft limit, but it gives no indication as to\nprecisely which string theory is dual to a particular gauge theory. For two dimensional\ngauge theories much progress has been made in formulating the appropriate string\ntheories [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], but for four dimensional gauge theories there was\nno concrete construction of a corresponding string theory before the results reported\nbelow, since the planar diagram expansion (which corresponds to the free string theory)\nis very complicated. Various direct approaches towards constructing the relevant string\ntheory were attempted, many of which were based on the loop equations [46] for the\nWilson loop observables in the \ufb01eld theory, which are directly connected to a string-\ntype description.\nAttempts to directly construct a string theory equivalent to a four dimensional gauge\ntheory are plagued with the well-known problems of string theory in four dimensions\n(or generally below the critical dimension). In particular, additional \ufb01elds must be\n15\n\n\nadded on the worldsheet beyond the four embedding coordinates of the string to ensure\nconsistency of the theory.\nIn the standard quantization of four dimensional string\ntheory an additional \ufb01eld called the Liouville \ufb01eld arises [4], which may be interpreted\nas a \ufb01fth space-time dimension.\nPolyakov has suggested [47, 48] that such a \ufb01ve\ndimensional string theory could be related to four dimensional gauge theories if the\ncouplings of the Liouville \ufb01eld to the other \ufb01elds take some speci\ufb01c forms. As we will\nsee, the AdS/CFT correspondence realizes this idea, but with \ufb01ve additional dimensions\n(in addition to the radial coordinate on AdS which can be thought of as a generalization\nof the Liouville \ufb01eld), leading to a standard (critical) ten dimensional string theory.\n1.3\nBlack p-Branes\nThe recent insight into the connection between large N \ufb01eld theories and string theory\nhas emerged from the study of p-branes in string theory. The p-branes were originally\nfound as classical solutions to supergravity, which is the low energy limit of string\ntheory. Later it was pointed out by Polchinski that D-branes give their full string\ntheoretical description. Various comparisons of the two descriptions led to the discovery\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n1.3.1\nClassical Solutions\nString theory has a variety of classical solutions corresponding to extended black holes\n[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. Complete descriptions of all possible black\nhole solutions would be beyond the scope of this review, and we will discuss here only\nillustrative examples corresponding to parallel Dp branes. For a more extensive review\nof extended objects in string theory, see [60, 61].\nLet us consider type II string theory in ten dimensions, and look for a black hole\nsolution carrying electric charge with respect to the Ramond-Ramond (R-R) (p + 1)-\nform Ap+1 [50, 55, 58]. In type IIA (IIB) theory, p is even (odd). The theory contains\nalso magnetically charged (6\u2212p)-branes, which are electrically charged under the dual\ndA7\u2212p = \u2217dAp+1 potential. Therefore, R-R charges have to be quantized according to\nthe Dirac quantization condition. To \ufb01nd the solution, we start with the low energy\ne\ufb00ective action in the string frame,\nS =\n1\n(2\u03c0)7l8\ns\nZ\nd10x\u221a\u2212g\n \ne\u22122\u03c6 \u0010\nR + 4(\u2207\u03c6)2\u0011\n\u2212\n2\n(8 \u2212p)!F 2\np+2\n!\n,\n(1.9)\nwhere ls is the string length, related to the string tension (2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032)\u22121 as \u03b1\u2032 = l2\ns, and Fp+2\nis the \ufb01eld strength of the (p + 1)-form potential, Fp+2 = dAp+1. In the self-dual case\nof p = 3 we work directly with the equations of motion. We then look for a solution\n16\n\n\ncorresponding to a p-dimensional electric source of charge N for Ap+1, by requiring the\nEuclidean symmetry ISO(p) in p-dimensions:\nds2 = ds2\n10\u2212p + e\u03b1\np\nX\ni=1\ndxidxi.\n(1.10)\nHere ds2\n10\u2212p is a Lorentzian-signature metric in (10 \u2212p)-dimensions. We also assume\nthat the metric is spherically symmetric in (10 \u2212p) dimensions with the R-R source at\nthe origin,\nZ\nS8\u2212p\n\u2217Fp+2 = N,\n(1.11)\nwhere S8\u2212p is the (8 \u2212p)-sphere surrounding the source.\nBy using the Euclidean\nsymmetry ISO(p), we can reduce the problem to the one of \ufb01nding a spherically\nsymmetric charged black hole solution in (10\u2212p) dimensions [50, 55, 58]. The resulting\nmetric, in the string frame, is given by\nds2 = \u2212f+(\u03c1)\nq\nf\u2212(\u03c1)\ndt2+\nq\nf\u2212(\u03c1)\np\nX\ni=1\ndxidxi+f\u2212(\u03c1)\u22121\n2 \u22125\u2212p\n7\u2212p\nf+(\u03c1)\nd\u03c12+r2f\u2212(\u03c1)\n1\n2\u22125\u2212p\n7\u2212p d\u21262\n8\u2212p, (1.12)\nwith the dilaton \ufb01eld,\ne\u22122\u03c6 = g\u22122\ns f\u2212(\u03c1)\u2212p\u22123\n2 ,\n(1.13)\nwhere\nf\u00b1(\u03c1) = 1 \u2212\n r\u00b1\n\u03c1\n!7\u2212p\n,\n(1.14)\nand gs is the asymptotic string coupling constant.\nThe parameters r+ and r\u2212are\nrelated to the mass M (per unit volume) and the RR charge N of the solution by\nM =\n1\n(7 \u2212p)(2\u03c0)7dpl8\nP\n\u0010\n(8 \u2212p)r7\u2212p\n+\n\u2212r7\u2212p\n\u2212\n\u0011\n,\nN =\n1\ndpgsl7\u2212p\ns\n(r+r\u2212)\n7\u2212p\n2 ,\n(1.15)\nwhere lP = g\n1\n4s ls is the 10-dimensional Planck length and dp is a numerical factor,\ndp = 25\u2212p\u03c0\n5\u2212p\n2 \u0393\n\u00127 \u2212p\n2\n\u0013\n.\n(1.16)\nThe metric in the Einstein frame, (gE)\u00b5\u03bd, is de\ufb01ned by multiplying the string frame\nmetric g\u00b5\u03bd by\nq\ngse\u2212\u03c6 in (1.9), so that the action takes the standard Einstein-Hilbert\nform,\nS =\n1\n(2\u03c0)7l8\nP\nZ\nd10x\u221a\u2212gE(RE \u22121\n2(\u2207\u03c6)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7).\n(1.17)\nThe Einstein frame metric has a horizon at \u03c1 = r+. For p \u22646, there is also a curvature\nsingularity at \u03c1 = r\u2212. When r+ > r\u2212, the singularity is covered by the horizon and\n17\n\n\nthe solution can be regarded as a black hole. When r+ < r\u2212, there is a timelike naked\nsingularity and the Cauchy problem is not well-posed.\nThe situation is subtle in the critical case r+ = r\u2212. If p \u0338= 3, the horizon and the\nsingularity coincide and there is a \u201cnull\u201d singularity4. Moreover, the dilaton either\ndiverges or vanishes at \u03c1 = r+. This singularity, however, is milder than in the case of\nr+ < r\u2212, and the supergravity description is still valid up to a certain distance from\nthe singularity. The situation is much better for p = 3. In this case, the dilaton is\nconstant. Moreover, the \u03c1 = r+ surface is regular even when r+ = r\u2212, allowing a\nsmooth analytic extension beyond \u03c1 = r+ [62].\nAccording to (1.15), for a \ufb01xed value of N, the mass M is an increasing function of\nr+. The condition r+ \u2265r\u2212for the absence of the timelike naked singularity therefore\ntranslates into an inequality between the mass M and the R-R charge N, of the form\nM \u2265\nN\n(2\u03c0)pgslp+1\ns\n.\n(1.18)\nThe solution whose mass M is at the lower bound of this inequality is called an extremal\np-brane. On the other hand, when M is strictly greater than that, we have a non-\nextremal black p-brane. It is called black since there is an event horizon for r+ > r\u2212.\nThe area of the black hole horizon goes to zero in the extremal limit r+ = r\u2212. Since\nthe extremal solution with p \u0338= 3 has a singularity, the supergravity description breaks\ndown near \u03c1 = r+ and we need to use the full string theory. The D-brane construction\ndiscussed below will give exactly such a description.\nThe inequality (1.18) is also\nthe BPS bound with respect to the 10-dimensional supersymmetry, and the extremal\nsolution r+ = r\u2212preserves one half of the supersymmetry in the regime where we can\ntrust the supergravity description. This suggests that the extremal p-brane is a ground\nstate of the black p-brane for a given charge N.\nThe extremal limit r+ = r\u2212of the solution (1.12) is given by\nds2 =\nq\nf+(\u03c1)\n \n\u2212dt2 +\np\nX\ni=1\ndxidxi\n!\n+ f+(\u03c1)\u22123\n2\u22125\u2212p\n7\u2212p d\u03c12 + \u03c12f+(\u03c1)\n1\n2 \u22125\u2212p\n7\u2212p d\u21262\n8\u2212p.\n(1.19)\nIn this limit, the symmetry of the metric is enhanced from the Euclidean group ISO(p)\nto the Poincar\u00b4e group ISO(p, 1). This \ufb01ts well with the interpretation that the extremal\nsolution corresponds to the ground state of the black p-brane. To describe the geometry\nof the extremal solution outside of the horizon, it is often useful to de\ufb01ne a new\ncoordinate r by\nr7\u2212p \u2261\u03c17\u2212p \u2212r7\u2212p\n+ ,\n(1.20)\n4This is the case for p < 6. For p = 6, the singularity is timelike as one can see from the fact that\nit can be lifted to the Kaluza-Klein monopole in 11 dimensions.\n18\n\n\nand introduce the isotropic coordinates, ra = r\u03b8a (a = 1, ..., 9 \u2212p;\nP\na(\u03b8a)2 = 1). The\nmetric and the dilaton for the extremal p-brane are then written as\nds2 =\n1\nq\nH(r)\n \n\u2212dt2 +\np\nX\ni=1\ndxidxi\n!\n+\nq\nH(r)\n9\u2212p\nX\na=1\ndradra,\n(1.21)\ne\u03c6 = gsH(r)\n3\u2212p\n4 ,\n(1.22)\nwhere\nH(r) =\n1\nf+(\u03c1) = 1 + r7\u2212p\n+\nr7\u2212p,\nr7\u2212p\n+\n= dpgsNl7\u2212p\ns\n.\n(1.23)\nThe horizon is now located at r = 0.\nIn general, (1.21) and (1.22) give a solution to the supergravity equations of motion\nfor any function H(\u20d7r) which is a harmonic function in the (9 \u2212p) dimensions which\nare transverse to the p-brane. For example, we may consider a more general solution,\nof the form\nH(\u20d7r) = 1 +\nk\nX\ni=1\nr7\u2212p\n(i)+\n|\u20d7r \u2212\u20d7ri|7\u2212p,\nr7\u2212p\n(i)+ = dpgsNil7\u2212p\ns\n.\n(1.24)\nThis is called a multi-centered solution and represents parallel extremal p-branes lo-\ncated at k di\ufb00erent locations, \u20d7r = \u20d7ri (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, k), each of which carries Ni units of\nthe R-R charge.\nSo far we have discussed the black p-brane using the classical supergravity. This\ndescription is appropriate when the curvature of the p-brane geometry is small com-\npared to the string scale, so that stringy corrections are negligible. Since the strength\nof the curvature is characterized by r+, this requires r+ \u226bls. To suppress string loop\ncorrections, the e\ufb00ective string coupling e\u03c6 also needs to be kept small. When p = 3,\nthe dilaton is constant and we can make it small everywhere in the 3-brane geome-\ntry by setting gs < 1, namely lP < ls. If gs > 1 we might need to do an S-duality,\ngs \u21921/gs, \ufb01rst. Moreover, in this case it is known that the metric (1.21) can be\nanalytically extended beyond the horizon r = 0, and that the maximally extended\nmetric is geodesically complete and without a singularity [62]. The strength of the cur-\nvature is then uniformly bounded by r\u22122\n+ . To summarize, for p = 3, the supergravity\napproximation is valid when\nlP < ls \u226ar+.\n(1.25)\nSince r+ is related to the R-R charge N as\nr7\u2212p\n+\n= dpgsNl7\u2212p\ns\n,\n(1.26)\nthis can also be expressed as\n1 \u226agsN < N.\n(1.27)\nFor p \u0338= 3, the metric is singular at r = 0, and the supergravity description is valid\nonly in a limited region of the spacetime.\n19\n\n\n1.3.2\nD-Branes\nAlternatively, the extremal p-brane can be described as a D-brane. For a review of D-\nbranes, see [63]. The Dp-brane is a (p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane in spacetime where\nan open string can end. By the worldsheet duality, this means that the D-brane is also\na source of closed strings (see Fig. 1.2). In particular, it can carry the R-R charges.\nIt was shown in [6] that, if we put N Dp-branes on top of each other, the resulting\n(p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane carries exactly N units of the (p + 1)-form charge. On\nthe worldsheet of a type II string, the left-moving degrees of freedom and the right-\nmoving degrees of freedom carry separate spacetime supercharges.\nSince the open\nstring boundary condition identi\ufb01es the left and right movers, the D-brane breaks at\nleast one half of the spacetime supercharges. In type IIA (IIB) string theory, precisely\none half of the supersymmetry is preserved if p is even (odd). This is consistent with\nthe types of R-R charges that appear in the theory. Thus, the Dp-brane is a BPS object\nin string theory which carries exactly the same charge as the black p-brane solution in\nsupergravity.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.2: (a) The D-brane is where open strings can end. (b) The D-brane is a source\nof closed strings.\nIt is believed that the extremal p-brane in supergravity and the Dp-brane are two\ndi\ufb00erent descriptions of the same object. The D-brane uses the string worldsheet and,\ntherefore, is a good description in string perturbation theory. When there are N D-\nbranes on top of each other, the e\ufb00ective loop expansion parameter for the open strings\nis gsN rather than gs, since each open string boundary loop ending on the D-branes\ncomes with the Chan-Paton factor N as well as the string coupling gs. Thus, the D-\nbrane description is good when gsN \u226a1. This is complementary to the regime (1.27)\nwhere the supergravity description is appropriate.\nThe low energy e\ufb00ective theory of open strings on the Dp-brane is the U(N) gauge\n20\n\n\ntheory in (p + 1) dimensions with 16 supercharges [9]. The theory has (9 \u2212p) scalar\n\ufb01elds \u20d7\u03a6 in the adjoint representation of U(N). If the vacuum expectation value \u27e8\u20d7\u03a6\u27e9has\nk distinct eigenvalues5, with N1 identical eigenvalues \u20d7\u03c61, N2 identical eigenvalues \u20d7\u03c62\nand so on, the gauge group U(N) is broken to U(N1) \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 U(Nk). This corresponds\nto the situation when N1 D-branes are at \u20d7r1 = \u20d7\u03c61l2\ns, N2 Dp-branes are at \u20d7r2 = \u20d7\u03c62l2\ns,\nand so on. In this case, there are massive W-bosons for the broken gauge groups.\nThe W-boson in the bi-fundamental representation of U(Ni) \u00d7 U(Nj) comes from the\nopen string stretching between the D-branes at \u20d7ri and \u20d7rj, and the mass of the W-\nboson is proportional to the Euclidean distance |\u20d7ri \u2212\u20d7rj| between the D-branes. It is\nimportant to note that the same result is obtained if we use the supergravity solution\nfor the multi-centered p-brane (1.24) and compute the mass of the string going from\n\u20d7ri to \u20d7rj, since the factor H(\u20d7r)\n1\n4 from the metric in the \u20d7r-space (1.21) is cancelled by\nthe redshift factor H(\u20d7r)\u22121\n4 when converting the string tension into energy. Both the\nD-brane description and the supergravity solution give the same value of the W-boson\nmass, since it is determined by the BPS condition.\n1.3.3\nGreybody Factors and Black Holes\nAn important precursor to the AdS/CFT correspondence was the calculation of grey-\nbody factors for black holes built out of D-branes. It was noted in [14] that Hawking\nradiation could be mimicked by processes where two open strings collide on a D-brane\nand form a closed string which propagates into the bulk. The classic computation of\nHawking (see, for example, [64] for details) shows in a semi-classical approximation\nthat the di\ufb00erential rate of spontaneous emission of particles of energy \u03c9 from a black\nhole is\nd\u0393emit =\nv\u03c3absorb\ne\u03c9/TH \u00b1 1\ndnk\n(2\u03c0)n ,\n(1.28)\nwhere v is the velocity of the emitted particle in the transverse directions, and the sign\nin the denominator is minus for bosons and plus for fermions. We use n to denote the\nnumber of spatial dimensions around the black hole (or if we are dealing with a black\nbrane, it is the number of spatial dimensions perpendicular to the world-volume of the\nbrane). TH is the Hawking temperature, and \u03c3absorb is the cross-section for a particle\ncoming in from in\ufb01nity to be absorbed by the black hole. In the di\ufb00erential emission\nrate, the emitted particle is required to have a momentum in a small region dnk, and\n\u03c9 is a function of k. To obtain a total emission rate we would integrate (1.28) over all\nk.\nIf \u03c3absorb were a constant, then (1.28) tells us that the emission spectrum is the same\n5There is a potential P\nI,J Tr[\u03a6I, \u03a6J]2 for the scalar \ufb01elds, so expectation values of the matrices\n\u03a6I (I = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9 \u2212p) minimizing the potential are simultaneously diagonalizable.\n21\n\n\nas that of a blackbody. Typically, \u03c3absorb is not constant, but varies appreciably over\nthe range of \ufb01nite \u03c9/TH. The consequent deviations from the pure blackbody spectrum\nhave earned \u03c3absorb the name \u201cgreybody factor.\u201d A successful microscopic account of\nblack hole thermodynamics should be able to predict these greybody factors. In [16]\nand its many successors, it was shown that the D-branes provided an account of black\nhole microstates which was successful in this respect.\nOur \ufb01rst goal will be to see how greybody factors are computed in the context of\nquantum \ufb01elds in curved spacetime. The literature on this subject is immense. We\nrefer the reader to [65] for an overview of the General Relativity literature, and to\n[18, 11, 61] and references therein for a \ufb01rst look at the string theory additions.\nIn studying scattering of particles o\ufb00of a black hole (or any \ufb01xed target), it is con-\nvenient to make a partial wave expansion. For simplicity, let us restrict the discussion\nto scalar \ufb01elds. Assuming that the black hole is spherically symmetric, one can write\nthe asymptotic behavior at in\ufb01nity of the time-independent scattering solution as\n\u03c6(\u20d7r) \u223ceikx + f(\u03b8) eikr\nrn/2\n\u223c\n\u221e\nX\n\u2113=0\n1\n2 \u02dcP\u2113(cos \u03b8)S\u2113eikr + (\u22121)\u2113ine\u2212ikr\n(ikr)n/2\n,\n(1.29)\nwhere x = r cos \u03b8. The term eikx represents the incident wave, and the second term\nin the \ufb01rst line represents the scattered wave.\nThe \u02dcP\u2113(cos \u03b8) are generalizations of\nLegendre polynomials. The absorption probability for a given partial wave is given by\nP\u2113= 1 \u2212|S\u2113|2. An application of the Optical Theorem leads to the absorption cross\nsection [66]\n\u03c3\u2113\nabs = 2n\u22121\u03c0\nn\u22121\n2\nkn\n\u0393\n\u0012n \u22121\n2\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u2113+ n \u22121\n2\n\u0013  \u2113+ n \u22122\n\u2113\n!\nP\u2113.\n(1.30)\nSometimes the absorption probability P\u2113is called the greybody factor.\nThe strategy of absorption calculations in supergravity is to solve a linearized wave\nequation, most often the Klein-Gordon equation\n\u03c6 = 0, using separation of variables,\n\u03c6 = e\u2212i\u03c9tP\u2113(cos \u03b8)R(r). Typically the radial function cannot be expressed in terms of\nknown functions, so some approximation scheme is used, as we will explain in more\ndetail below. Boundary conditions are imposed at the black hole horizon corresponding\nto infalling matter. Once the solution is obtained, one can either use the asymptotics\n(1.29) to obtain S\u2113and from it P\u2113and \u03c3\u2113\nabs, or compute the particle \ufb02ux at in\ufb01nity\nand at the horizon and note that particle number conservation implies that P\u2113is their\nratio.\nOne of the few known universal results is that for \u03c9/TH \u226a1, \u03c3abs for an s-wave\nmassless scalar approaches the horizon area of the black hole [67]. This result holds\n22\n\n\nfor any spherically symmetric black hole in any dimension. For \u03c9 much larger than\nany characteristic curvature scale of the geometry, one can use the geometric optics\napproximation to \ufb01nd \u03c3abs.\nWe will be interested in the particular black hole geometries for which string theory\nprovides a candidate description of the microstates. Let us start with N coincident\nD3-branes, where the low-energy world-volume theory is d = 4 N = 4 U(N) gauge\ntheory. The equation of motion for the dilaton is\n\u03c6 = 0 where\nis the laplacian for\nthe metric\nds2 =\n \n1 + R4\nr4\n!\u22121/2 \u0010\n\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2 + dx2\n3\n\u0011\n+\n \n1 + R4\nr4\n!1/2 \u0010\ndr2 + r2d\u21262\n5\n\u0011\n. (1.31)\nIt is convenient to change radial variables: r = Re\u2212z, \u03c6 = e2z\u03c8. The radial equation\nfor the \u2113th partial wave is\nh\n\u22022\nz + 2\u03c92R2 cosh 2z \u2212(\u2113+ 2)2i\n\u03c8\u2113(z) = 0 ,\n(1.32)\nwhich is precisely Schrodinger\u2019s equation with a potential V (z) = \u22122\u03c92R2 cosh 2z. The\nabsorption probability is precisely the tunneling probability for the barrier V (z): the\ntransmitted wave at large positive z represents particles falling into the D3-branes. At\nleading order in small \u03c9R, the absorption probability for the \u2113th partial wave is\nP\u2113=\n4\u03c02\n(\u2113+ 1)!4(\u2113+ 2)2\n\u0012\u03c9R\n2\n\u00138+4\u2113\n.\n(1.33)\nThis result, together with a recursive algorithm for computing all corrections as a\nseries in \u03c9R, was obtained in [68] from properties of associated Mathieu functions,\nwhich are the solutions of (1.32). An exact solution of a radial equation in terms of\nknown special functions is rare. We will therefore present a standard approximation\ntechnique (developed in [69] and applied to the problem at hand in [10]) which is\nsu\ufb03cient to obtain the leading term of (1.33). Besides, for comparison with string\ntheory predictions we are generally interested only in this leading term.\nThe idea is to \ufb01nd limiting forms of the radial equation which can be solved exactly,\nand then to match the limiting solutions together to approximate the full solution.\nUsually a uniformly good approximation can be found in the limit of small energy. The\nreason, intuitively speaking, is that on a compact range of radii excluding asymptotic\nin\ufb01nity and the horizon, the zero energy solution is nearly equal to solutions with very\nsmall energy; and outside this region the wave equation usually has a simple limiting\nform. So one solves the equation in various regions and then matches together a global\nsolution.\n23\n\n\nIt is elementary to show that this can be done for (1.32) using two regions:\nfar region: z \u226blog \u03c9R\nh\n\u22022\nz + \u03c92R2e2z \u2212(\u2113+ 2)2i\n\u03c8 = 0\n\u03c8(z) = H(1)\n\u2113+2(\u03c9Rez)\nnear region: z \u226a\u2212log \u03c9R\nh\n\u22022\nz + \u03c92R2e\u22122z \u2212(\u2113+ 2)2i\n\u03c8 = 0\n\u03c8(z) = aJ\u2113+2(\u03c9Re\u2212z)\n(1.34)\nIt is amusing to note the Z2 symmetry, z \u2192\u2212z, which exchanges the far region,\nwhere the \ufb01rst equation in (1.34) is just free particle propagation in \ufb02at space, and\nthe near region, where the second equation in (1.34) describes a free particle in AdS5.\nThis peculiar symmetry was \ufb01rst pointed out in [10]. It follows from the fact that the\nfull D3-brane metric comes back to itself, up to a conformal rescaling, if one sends\nr \u2192R2/r. A similar duality exists between six-dimensional \ufb02at space and AdS3 \u00d7 S3\nin the D1-D5-brane solution, where the Laplace equation again can be solved in terms\nof Mathieu functions [70, 71]. To our knowledge there is no deep understanding of this\n\u201cinversion duality.\u201d\nFor low energies \u03c9R \u226a1, the near and far regions overlap in a large domain,\nlog \u03c9R \u226az \u226a\u2212log \u03c9R, and by comparing the solutions in this overlap region one can\n\ufb01x a and reproduce the leading term in (1.33). It is possible but tedious to obtain the\nleading correction by treating the small terms which were dropped from the potential\nto obtain the limiting forms in (1.34) as perturbations. This strategy was pursued\nin [72, 73] before the exact solution was known, and in cases where there is no exact\nsolution. The validity of the matching technique is discussed in [65], but we know of\nno rigorous proof that it holds in all the circumstances in which it has been applied.\nThe successful comparison of the s-wave dilaton cross-section in [10] with a per-\nturbative calculation on the D3-brane world-volume was the \ufb01rst hint that Green\u2019s\nfunctions of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory could be computed from supergravity.\nIn summarizing the calculation, we will follow more closely the conventions of [11],\nand give an indication of the \ufb01rst application of non-renormalization arguments [12] to\nunderstand why the agreement between supergravity and perturbative gauge theory\nexisted despite their applicability in opposite limits of the \u2019t Hooft coupling.\nSetting normalization conventions so that the pole in the propagator of the gauge\nbosons has residue one at tree level, we have the following action for the dilaton plus\nthe \ufb01elds on the brane:\nS =\n1\n2\u03ba2\nZ\nd10x\u221ag\nh\nR \u22121\n2(\u2202\u03c6)2 + . . .\ni\n+\nZ\nd4x\nh\n\u22121\n4e\u2212\u03c6TrF 2\n\u00b5\u03bd + . . .\ni\n,\n(1.35)\nwhere we have omitted other supergravity \ufb01elds, their interactions with one another,\nand also terms with the lower spin \ufb01elds in the gauge theory action. A plane wave\n24\n\n\nof dilatons with energy \u03c9 and momentum perpendicular to the brane is kinematically\nequivalent on the world-volume to a massive particle which can decay into two gauge\nbosons through the coupling 1\n4\u03c6TrF 2\n\u00b5\u03bd. In fact, the absorption cross-section is given\nprecisely by the usual expression for the decay rate into k particles:\n\u03c3abs = 1\nSf\n1\n2\u03c9\nZ\nd3p1\n(2\u03c0)32\u03c91\n. . .\nd3pk\n(2\u03c0)32\u03c9k\n(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(Pf \u2212Pi)|M|\n2 .\n(1.36)\nIn the Feynman rules for M, a factor of\n\u221a\n2\u03ba2 attaches to an external dilaton line on\naccount of the non-standard normalization of its kinetic term in (1.35). This factor\ngives \u03c3abs the correct dimensions: it is a length to the \ufb01fth power, as appropriate for six\ntransverse spatial dimensions. In (1.36), |M|\n2 indicates summation over distinguishable\nprocesses: in the case of the s-wave dilaton there are N2 such processes because of the\nnumber of gauge bosons. One easily veri\ufb01es that |M|\n2 = N2\u03ba2\u03c94. Sf is a symmetry\nfactor for identical particles in the \ufb01nal state: in the case of the s-wave dilaton, Sf = 2\nbecause the outgoing gauge bosons are identical.\nCarrying out the \u2113= 0 calculation explicitly, one \ufb01nds\n\u03c3abs = N2\u03ba2\u03c93\n32\u03c0\n,\n(1.37)\nwhich, using (1.30) and the relation between R and N, can be shown to be in precise\nagreement with the leading term of P0 in (1.33). This is now understood to be due to\na non-renormalization theorem for the two-point function of the operator O4 = 1\n4TrF 2.\nTo understand the connection with two-point functions, note that an absorption\ncalculation is insensitive to the \ufb01nal state on the D-brane world-volume. The absorption\ncross-section is therefore related to the discontinuity in the cut of the two-point function\nof the operator to which the external \ufb01eld couples. To state a result of some generality,\nlet us suppose that a scalar \ufb01eld \u03c6 in ten dimensions couples to a gauge theory operator\nthrough the action\nSint =\nZ\nd4x \u2202yi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2202yi\u2113\u03c6(x, yi)\n\f\f\f\nyi=0Oi1...i\u2113(x) ,\n(1.38)\nwhere we use x to denote the four coordinates parallel to the world-volume and yi to\ndenote the other six. An example where this would be the right sort of coupling is the\n\u2113th partial wave of the dilaton [11]. The \u2113th partial wave absorption cross-section for\na particle with initial momentum p = \u03c9(\u02c6t + \u02c6y1) is obtained by summing over all \ufb01nal\n25\n\n\nX\nX\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\np\n\u0002\u0014\n\u0002\n}X\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\n2\n= 2\u03ba2\ni Disc\nFigure 1.3: An application of the optical theorem.\nstates that could be created by the operator O1...1:6\n\u03c3abs = 1\n2\u03c9\nX\nn\nn\nY\ni=1\n1\nSf\nd3pi\n(2\u03c0)32\u03c9i\n(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(Pf \u2212Pi)|M|\n2\n= 2\u03ba2\u03c9\u2113\n2i\u03c9 Disc\nZ\nd4x eip\u00b7x\u27e8O1...1(x)O1...1(0)\u27e9\n\f\f\f\np=(\u03c9,0,0,0) .\n(1.39)\nIn the second equality we have applied the Optical Theorem (see \ufb01gure 1.3). The\nfactor of 2\u03ba2 is the square of the external leg factor for the incoming closed string\nstate, which was included in the invariant amplitude M. The factor of \u03c9\u2113arises from\nacting with the \u2113derivatives in (1.38) on the incoming plane wave state. The symbol\nDisc indicates that one is looking at the unitarity cut in the two-point function in the\ns plane, where s = p2. The two-point function can be reconstructed uniquely from\nthis cut, together with some weak conditions on regularity for large momenta. Results\nanalogous to (1.39) can be stated for incoming particles with spin, only it becomes\nmore complicated because a polarization must be speci\ufb01ed, and the two-point function\nin momentum space includes a polynomial in p which depends on the polarization.\nExpressing absorption cross-sections in terms of two-point functions helps illustrate\nwhy there is ever agreement between the tree-level calculation indicated in (1.36) and\nthe supergravity result, which one would a priori expect to pick up all sorts of ra-\ndiative corrections. Indeed, it was observed in [12] that the s-wave graviton cross-\nsection agreed between supergravity and tree-level gauge theory because the correlator\n\u27e8T\u03b1\u03b2T\u03b3\u03b4\u27e9enjoys a non-renormalization theorem. One way to see that there must be\nsuch a non-renormalization theorem is to note that conformal Ward identities relate\nthis two-point function to \u27e8T \u00b5\n\u00b5 T\u03b1\u03b2T\u03b3\u03b4\u27e9(see for example [74] for the details), and su-\npersymmetry in turn relates this anomalous three-point function to the anomalous\nVEV\u2019s of the divergence of R-currents in the presence of external sources for them.\nThe Adler-Bardeen theorem [75] protects these anomalies, hence the conclusion.\nAnother case which has been studied extensively is a system consisting of several\nD1 and D5 branes. The D1-branes are delocalized on the four extra dimensions of\nthe D5-brane, which are taken to be small, so that the total system is e\ufb00ectively 1+1-\n6There is one restriction on the \ufb01nal states: for a process to be regarded as an \u2113th partial wave\nabsorption cross-section, \u2113units of angular momentum must be picked up by the brane. Thus Oi1...i\u2113\nmust transform in the irreducible representation which is the \u2113th traceless symmetric power of the 6\nof SO(6).\n26\n\n\ndimensional. We will discuss the physics of this system more extensively in chapter 5,\nand the reader can also \ufb01nd background material in [61].\nFor now our purpose is\nto show how supergravity absorption calculations relate to \ufb01nite-temperature Green\u2019s\nfunctions in the 1+1-dimensional theory.\nIntroducing momentum along the spatial world-volume (carried by open strings at-\ntached to the branes), one obtains the following ten-dimensional metric and dilaton:\nds2\n10,str = H\u22121/2\n1\nH\u22121/2\n5\n\"\n\u2212dt2 + dx2\n5 + r2\n0\nr2(cosh \u03c3dt + sinh \u03c3dx5)2\n#\n+ H1/2\n1\nH\u22121/2\n5\n4\nX\ni=1\ndy2\ni + H1/2\n1\nH1/2\n5\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n \n1 \u2212r2\n0\nr2\n!\u22121\ndr2 + r2d\u21262\n3\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\ne\u03c6\u2212\u03c6\u221e= H1/2\n1\nH\u22121/2\n5\nH1 = 1 + r2\n1\nr2\nH5 = 1 + r2\n5\nr2 .\n(1.40)\nThe quantities r2\n1, r2\n5, and r2\nK = r2\n0 sinh2 \u03c3 are related to the number of D1-branes, the\nnumber of D5-branes, and the net number of units of momentum in the x5 direction,\nrespectively. The horizon radius, r0, is related to the non-extremality. For details, see\nfor example [18]. If r0 = 0 then there are only left-moving open strings on the world-\nvolume; if r0 \u0338= 0 then there are both left-movers and right-movers. The Hawking\ntemperature can be expressed as\n2\nTH =\n1\nTL +\n1\nTR, where\nTL = 1\n\u03c0\nr0e\u03c3\n2r1r5\nTR = 1\n\u03c0\nr0e\u2212\u03c3\n2r1r5\n.\n(1.41)\nTL and TR have the interpretation of temperatures of the left-moving and right-moving\nsectors of the 1+1-dimensional world-volume theory. There is a detailed and remark-\nably successful account of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy using statistical mechanics\nin the world-volume theory. It was initiated in [13], developed in a number of subse-\nquent papers, and has been reviewed in [61].\nThe region of parameter space which we will be interested in is\nr0, rK \u226ar1, r5\n(1.42)\nThis is known as the dilute gas regime. The total energy of the open strings on the\nbranes is much less than the constituent mass of either the D1-branes or the D5-branes.\nWe are also interested in low energies \u03c9r1, \u03c9r5 \u226a1, but \u03c9/TL,R can be arbitrary thanks\nto (1.42), (1.41).\nThe D1-D5-brane system is not stable because left-moving open\nstrings can run into right-moving open string and form a closed string: indeed, this\nis exactly the process we aim to quantify. Since we have collisions of left and right\n27\n\n\nmoving excitations we expect that the answer will contain the left and right moving\noccupation factors, so that the emission rate is\nd\u0393 = g2\neff\n1\n(e\n\u03c9\n2TL \u22121)\n1\n(e\n\u03c9\n2TR \u22121)\nd4k\n(2\u03c0)4\n(1.43)\nwhere geff is independent of the temperature and measures the coupling of the open\nstrings to the closed strings. The functional form of (1.43) seems, at \ufb01rst sight, to be\ndi\ufb00erent from (1.28). But in order to compare them we should calculate the absorption\ncross section appearing in (1.28).\nO\ufb00-diagonal gravitons hy1y2 (with y1,2 in the compact directions) reduce to scalars\nin six dimensions which obey the massless Klein Gordon equation. These so-called\nminimal scalars have been the subject of the most detailed study. We will consider\nonly the s-wave and we take the momentum along the string to be zero. Separation of\nvariables leads to the radial equation\n\" h\nr3\u2202rhr2\u2202r + \u03c92f\n#\nR = 0 ,\nh = 1 \u2212r2\n0\nr2,\nf =\n \n1 + r2\n1\nr2\n!  \n1 + r2\n5\nr2\n!  \n1 + r2\n0 sinh2 \u03c3\nr2\n!\n.\n(1.44)\nClose to the horizon, a convenient radial variable is z = h = 1 \u2212r2\n0/r2.

In this situation we\nreplace the whole black hole geometry (a) by a point-like system in the transverse\ncoordinates with localized excitations (b). These excitations are the ones described by\nthe \ufb01eld theory living on the brane.\nIt is possible to be more precise and calculate the coe\ufb03cient in (1.43) and actually\ncheck that the matching is precise [16]. We leave this to chapter 5.\nBoth in the D3-brane analysis and in the D1-D5-brane analysis, one can see that all\nthe interesting physics is resulting from the near-horizon region: the far region wave-\nfunction describes free particle propagation. For quanta whose Compton wavelength is\nmuch larger than the size of the black hole, the e\ufb00ect of the far region is merely to set\nthe boundary conditions in the near region. See \ufb01gure 1.4. This provides a motivation\nfor the prescription for computing Green\u2019s functions, to be described in section 3.3: as\nthe calculations of this section demonstrate, cutting out the near-horizon region of the\nsupergravity geometry and replacing it with the D-branes leads to an identical response\nto low-energy external probes.\n29\n\n\nChapter 2\nConformal Field Theories and AdS\nSpaces\n2.1\nConformal Field Theories\nSymmetry principles, and in particular Lorentz and Poincar\u00b4e invariance, play a major\nrole in our understanding of quantum \ufb01eld theory. It is natural to look for possible\ngeneralizations of Poincar\u00b4e invariance in the hope that they may play some role in\nphysics; in [76] it was argued that for theories with a non-trivial S-matrix there are\nno such bosonic generalizations. An interesting generalization of Poincar\u00b4e invariance\nis the addition of a scale invariance symmetry linking physics at di\ufb00erent scales (this\nis inconsistent with the existence of an S-matrix since it does not allow the standard\nde\ufb01nition of asymptotic states). Many interesting \ufb01eld theories, like Yang-Mills theory\nin four dimensions, are scale-invariant; generally this scale invariance does not extend\nto the quantum theory (whose de\ufb01nition requires a cuto\ufb00which explicitly breaks scale\ninvariance) but in some special cases (such as the d = 4, N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-\nMills theory) it does, and even when it does not (like in QCD) it can still be a useful\ntool, leading to relations like the Callan-Symanzik equation. It was realized in the past\n30 years that \ufb01eld theories generally exhibit a renormalization group \ufb02ow from some\nscale-invariant (often free) UV \ufb01xed point to some scale-invariant (sometimes trivial)\nIR \ufb01xed point, and statistical mechanics systems also often have non-trivial IR scale-\ninvariant \ufb01xed points. Thus, studying scale-invariant theories is interesting for various\nphysical applications.\nIt is widely believed that unitary interacting scale-invariant theories are always in-\nvariant under the full conformal group, which is a simple group including scale invari-\nance and Poincar\u00b4e invariance. This has only been proven in complete generality for\ntwo dimensional \ufb01eld theories [77, 78], but there are no known counter-examples. In\nthis section we will review the conformal group and its implications for \ufb01eld theories,\n30\n\n\nfocusing on implications which will be useful in the context of the AdS/CFT corre-\nspondence. General reviews on conformal \ufb01eld theories may be found in [79, 80, 81]\nand references therein.\n2.1.1\nThe Conformal Group and Algebra\nThe conformal group is the group of transformations which preserve the form of the\nmetric up to an arbitrary scale factor, g\u00b5\u03bd(x) \u2192\u21262(x)g\u00b5\u03bd(x) (in this section greek\nletters will correspond to the space-time coordinates, \u00b5, \u03bd = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, d \u22121). It is the\nminimal group that includes the Poincar\u00b4e group as well as the inversion symmetry\nx\u00b5 \u2192x\u00b5/x2.\nThe conformal group of Minkowski space1 is generated by the Poincar\u00b4e transforma-\ntions, the scale transformation\nx\u00b5 \u2192\u03bbx\u00b5,\n(2.1)\nand the special conformal transformations\nx\u00b5 \u2192\nx\u00b5 + a\u00b5x2\n1 + 2x\u03bda\u03bd + a2x2.\n(2.2)\nWe will denote the generators of these transformations by M\u00b5\u03bd for the Lorentz trans-\nformations, P\u00b5 for translations, D for the scaling transformation (2.1) and K\u00b5 for the\nspecial conformal transformations (2.2). The vacuum of a conformal theory is annihi-\nlated by all of these generators. They obey the conformal algebra\n[M\u00b5\u03bd, P\u03c1] = \u2212i(\u03b7\u00b5\u03c1P\u03bd \u2212\u03b7\u03bd\u03c1P\u00b5);\n[M\u00b5\u03bd, K\u03c1] = \u2212i(\u03b7\u00b5\u03c1K\u03bd \u2212\u03b7\u03bd\u03c1K\u00b5);\n[M\u00b5\u03bd, M\u03c1\u03c3] = \u2212i\u03b7\u00b5\u03c1M\u03bd\u03c3 \u00b1 permutations;\n[M\u00b5\u03bd, D] = 0;\n[D, K\u00b5] = iK\u00b5;\n[D, P\u00b5] = \u2212iP\u00b5;\n[P\u00b5, K\u03bd] = 2iM\u00b5\u03bd \u22122i\u03b7\u00b5\u03bdD,\n(2.3)\nwith all other commutators vanishing. This algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of\nSO(d, 2), and can be put in the standard form of the SO(d, 2) algebra (with signature\n\u2212, +, +, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, +, \u2212) with generators Jab (a, b = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d + 1) by de\ufb01ning\nJ\u00b5\u03bd = M\u00b5\u03bd;\nJ\u00b5d = 1\n2(K\u00b5 \u2212P\u00b5);\nJ\u00b5(d+1) = 1\n2(K\u00b5 + P\u00b5);\nJ(d+1)d = D. (2.4)\nFor some applications it is useful to study the conformal theory in Euclidean space; in\nthis case the conformal group is SO(d + 1, 1),2 and since Rd is conformally equivalent\nto Sd the \ufb01eld theory on Rd (with appropriate boundary conditions at in\ufb01nity) is\n1More precisely, some of these transformations can take \ufb01nite points in Minkowski space to in\ufb01nity,\nso they should be de\ufb01ned on a compacti\ufb01cation of Minkowski space which includes points at in\ufb01nity.\n2Strictly speaking, SO(d+1, 1) is the connected component of the conformal group which includes\nthe identity, and it does not include x\u00b5 \u2192x\u00b5/x2. We will hereafter ignore such subtleties.\n31\n\n\nisomorphic to the theory on Sd. Much of what we say below will apply also to the\nEuclidean theory.\nIn the special case of d = 2 the conformal group is larger, and in fact it is in\ufb01nite\ndimensional. The special aspects of this case will be discussed in chapter 5 where they\nwill be needed.\n2.1.2\nPrimary Fields, Correlation Functions, and Operator\nProduct Expansions\nThe interesting representations (for physical applications) of the conformal group in-\nvolve operators (or \ufb01elds) which are eigenfunctions of the scaling operator D with\neigenvalue \u2212i\u2206(\u2206is called the scaling dimension of the \ufb01eld). This means that under\nthe scaling transformation (2.1) they transform as \u03c6(x) \u2192\u03c6\u2032(x) = \u03bb\u2206\u03c6(\u03bbx). The com-\nmutation relations (2.3) imply that the operator P\u00b5 raises the dimension of the \ufb01eld,\nwhile the operator K\u00b5 lowers it. In unitary \ufb01eld theories there is a lower bound on the\ndimension of \ufb01elds (for scalar \ufb01elds it is \u2206\u2265(d \u22122)/2 which is the dimension of a free\nscalar \ufb01eld), and, therefore, each representation of the conformal group which appears\nmust have some operator of lowest dimension, which must then be annihilated by K\u00b5\n(at x = 0). Such operators are called primary operators. The action of the conformal\ngroup on such operators is given by [82]\n[P\u00b5, \u03a6(x)] = i\u2202\u00b5\u03a6(x),\n[M\u00b5\u03bd, \u03a6(x)] = [i(x\u00b5\u2202\u03bd \u2212x\u03bd\u2202\u00b5) + \u03a3\u00b5\u03bd]\u03a6(x),\n[D, \u03a6(x)] = i(\u2212\u2206+ x\u00b5\u2202\u00b5)\u03a6(x),\n[K\u00b5, \u03a6(x)] = [i(x2\u2202\u00b5 \u22122x\u00b5x\u03bd\u2202\u03bd + 2x\u00b5\u2206) \u22122x\u03bd\u03a3\u00b5\u03bd]\u03a6(x),\n(2.5)\nwhere \u03a3\u00b5\u03bd are the matrices of a \ufb01nite dimensional representation of the Lorentz group,\nacting on the indices of the \u03a6 \ufb01eld. The representations of the conformal group cor-\nresponding to primary operators are classi\ufb01ed by the Lorentz representation and the\nscaling dimension \u2206(these determine the Casimirs of the conformal group). These\nrepresentations include the primary \ufb01eld and all the \ufb01elds which are obtained by act-\ning on it with the generators of the conformal group (speci\ufb01cally with P\u00b5). Since the\noperators in these representations are eigenfunctions of D, they cannot in general be\neigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian P0 or of the mass operator M2 = \u2212P \u00b5P\u00b5 (which is a\nCasimir operator of the Poincar\u00b4e group but not of the conformal group); in fact, they\nhave a continuous spectrum of M2 ranging from 0 to \u221e(there are also representations\ncorresponding to free massless \ufb01elds which have M2 = 0).\nAnother possible classi\ufb01cation of the representations of the conformal group is in\nterms of its maximal compact subgroup, which is SO(d) \u00d7 SO(2). The generator of\n32\n\n\nSO(2) is J0(d+1) =\n1\n2(K0 + P0), and the representations of the conformal group de-\nscribed above may be decomposed into representations of this subgroup. This is useful\nin particular for the oscillator constructions of the representations of superconformal\nalgebras [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89], which we will not describe in detail here (see\n[90] for a recent review). This subgroup is also useful in the radial quantization of\nthe conformal \ufb01eld theory on Sd\u22121 \u00d7 R, which will be related to AdS space in global\ncoordinates.\nSince the conformal group is much larger than the Poincar\u00b4e group, it severely restricts\nthe correlation functions of primary \ufb01elds, which must be invariant under conformal\ntransformations.\nIt has been shown by Luscher and Mack [91] that the Euclidean\nGreen\u2019s functions of a CFT may be analytically continued to Minkowski space, and\nthat the resulting Hilbert space carries a unitary representation of the Lorentzian\nconformal group. The formulas we will write here for correlation functions apply both\nin Minkowski and in Euclidean space. It is easy to show using the conformal algebra\nthat the 2-point functions of \ufb01elds of di\ufb00erent dimension vanish, while for a single\nscalar \ufb01eld of scaling dimension \u2206we have\n\u27e8\u03c6(0)\u03c6(x)\u27e9\u221d\n1\n|x|2\u2206\u2261\n1\n(x2)\u2206.\n(2.6)\n3-point functions are also determined (up to a constant) by the conformal group to be\nof the form\n\u27e8\u03c6i(x1)\u03c6j(x2)\u03c6k(x3)\u27e9=\ncijk\n|x1 \u2212x2|\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u22063|x1 \u2212x3|\u22061+\u22063\u2212\u22062|x2 \u2212x3|\u22062+\u22063\u2212\u22061 . (2.7)\nSimilar expressions (possibly depending on additional constants) arise for non-scalar\n\ufb01elds. With 4 independent xi one can construct two combinations of the xi (known as\nharmonic ratios) which are conformally invariant, so the correlation function can be any\nfunction of these combinations; for higher n-point functions there are more and more\nindependent functions which can appear in the correlation functions. Many other prop-\nerties of conformal \ufb01eld theories are also easily determined using the conformal invari-\nance; for instance, their equation of state is necessarily of the form S = cV (E/V )(d\u22121)/d\nfor some constant c.\nThe \ufb01eld algebra of any conformal \ufb01eld theory includes the energy-momentum tensor\nT\u00b5\u03bd which is an operator of dimension \u2206= d; the Ward identities of the conformal al-\ngebra relate correlation functions with T to correlation functions without T. Similarly,\nwhenever there are global symmetries, their (conserved) currents J\u00b5 are necessarily\noperators of dimension \u2206= d \u22121. The scaling dimensions of other operators are not\ndetermined by the conformal group, and generally they receive quantum corrections.\nFor any type of \ufb01eld there is, however, a lower bound on its dimension which follows\n33\n\n\nfrom unitarity; as mentioned above, for scalar \ufb01elds the bound is \u2206\u2265(d\u22122)/2, where\nequality can occur only for free scalar \ufb01elds.\nA general property of local \ufb01eld theories is the existence of an operator product\nexpansion (OPE). As we bring two operators O1(x) and O2(y) to the same point, their\nproduct creates a general local disturbance at that point, which may be expressed as\na sum of local operators acting at that point; in general all operators with the same\nglobal quantum numbers as O1O2 may appear. The general expression for the OPE\nis O1(x)O2(y) \u2192P\nn Cn\n12(x \u2212y)On(y), where this expression should be understood as\nappearing inside correlation functions, and the coe\ufb03cient functions Cn\n12 do not depend\non the other operators in the correlation function (the expression is useful when the\ndistance to all other operators is much larger than |x \u2212y|). In a conformal theory, the\nfunctional form of the OPE coe\ufb03cients is determined by conformal invariance to be\nCn\n12(x \u2212y) = cn\n12/|x \u2212y|\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u2206n, where the constants cn\n12 are related to the 3-point\nfunctions described above. The leading terms in the OPE of the energy-momentum\ntensor with primary \ufb01elds are determined by the conformal algebra. For instance, for\na scalar primary \ufb01eld \u03c6 of dimension \u2206in four dimensions,\nT\u00b5\u03bd(x)\u03c6(0) \u221d\u2206\u03c6(0)\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd( 1\nx2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(2.8)\nOne of the basic properties of conformal \ufb01eld theories is the one-to-one correspon-\ndence between local operators O and states |O\u27e9in the radial quantization of the theory.\nIn radial quantization the time coordinate is chosen to be the radial direction in Rd,\nwith the origin corresponding to past in\ufb01nity, so that the \ufb01eld theory lives on R\u00d7Sd\u22121.\nThe Hamiltonian in this quantization is the operator J0(d+1) mentioned above. An op-\nerator O can then be mapped to the state |O\u27e9= limx\u21920 O(x)|0\u27e9. Equivalently, the\nstate may be viewed as a functional of \ufb01eld values on some ball around the origin, and\nthen the state corresponding to O is de\ufb01ned by a functional integral on a ball around\nthe origin with the insertion of the operator O at the origin. The inverse mapping of\nstates to operators proceeds by taking a state which is a functional of \ufb01eld values on\nsome ball around the origin and using conformal invariance to shrink the ball to zero\nsize, in which case the insertion of the state is necessarily equivalent to the insertion\nof some local operator.\n2.1.3\nSuperconformal Algebras and Field Theories\nAnother interesting generalization of the Poincar\u00b4e algebra is the supersymmetry alge-\nbra, which includes additional fermionic operators Q which anti-commute to the trans-\nlation operators P\u00b5. It is interesting to ask whether supersymmetry and the conformal\ngroup can be joined together to form the largest possible simple algebra including the\n34\n\n\nPoincar\u00b4e group; it turns out that in some dimensions and for some numbers of su-\npersymmetry charges this is indeed possible. The full classi\ufb01cation of superconformal\nalgebras was given by Nahm [92]; it turns out that superconformal algebras exist only\nfor d \u22646. In addition to the generators of the conformal group and the supersymme-\ntry, superconformal algebras include two other types of generators. There are fermionic\ngenerators S (one for each supersymmetry generator) which arise in the commutator\nof K\u00b5 with Q, and there are (sometimes) R-symmetry generators forming some Lie\nalgebra, which appear in the anti-commutator of Q and S (the generators Q and S are\nin the fundamental representation of this Lie algebra). Schematically (suppressing all\nindices), the commutation relations of the superconformal algebra include, in addition\nto (2.3), the relations\n[D, Q] = \u2212i\n2Q;\n[D, S] = i\n2S;\n[K, Q] \u2243S;\n[P, S] \u2243Q;\n{Q, Q} \u2243P;\n{S, S} \u2243K;\n{Q, S} \u2243M + D + R.\n(2.9)\nThe exact form of the commutation relations is di\ufb00erent for di\ufb00erent dimensions (since\nthe spinorial representations of the conformal group behave di\ufb00erently) and for di\ufb00erent\nR-symmetry groups, and we will not write them explicitly here.\nFor free \ufb01eld theories without gravity, which do not include \ufb01elds whose spin is\nbigger than one, the maximal possible number of supercharges is 16 (a review of \ufb01eld\ntheories with this number of supercharges appears in [93]); it is believed that this is the\nmaximal possible number of supercharges also in interacting \ufb01eld theories. Therefore,\nthe maximal possible number of fermionic generators in a \ufb01eld theory superconformal\nalgebra is 32. Superconformal \ufb01eld theories with this number of supercharges exist\nonly for d = 3, 4, 6 (d = 1 may also be possible but there are no known examples). For\nd = 3 the R-symmetry group is Spin(8) and the fermionic generators are in the (4, 8)\nof SO(3, 2) \u00d7 Spin(8); for d = 4 the R-symmetry group is SU(4) and3 the fermionic\ngenerators are in the (4, 4)+(4, 4) of SO(4, 2)\u00d7SU(4); and for d = 6 the R-symmetry\ngroup is Sp(2) \u2243SO(5) and the fermionic generators are in the (8, 4) representation\nof SO(6, 2) \u00d7 Sp(2).\nSince the conformal algebra is a subalgebra of the superconformal algebra, represen-\ntations of the superconformal algebra split into several representations of the conformal\nalgebra. Generally a primary \ufb01eld of the superconformal algebra, which is (by de\ufb01ni-\ntion) annihilated (at x = 0) by the generators K\u00b5 and S, will include several primaries\nof the conformal algebra, which arise by acting with the supercharges Q on the su-\nperconformal primary \ufb01eld. The superconformal algebras have special representations\ncorresponding to chiral primary operators, which are primary operators which are an-\nnihilated by some combination of the supercharges. These representations are smaller\n3Note that this is di\ufb00erent from the other N-extended superconformal algebras in four dimensions\nwhich have a U(N) R-symmetry.\n35\n\n\nthan the generic representations, containing less conformal-primary \ufb01elds. A special\nproperty of chiral primary operators is that their dimension is uniquely determined by\ntheir R-symmetry representations and cannot receive any quantum corrections. This\nfollows by using the fact that all the S generators and some of the Q generators anni-\nhilate the \ufb01eld, and using the {Q, S} commutation relation to compute the eigenvalue\nof D in terms of the Lorentz and R-symmetry representations [94, 95, 96, 93, 97]. The\ndimensions of non-chiral primary \ufb01elds of the same representation are always strictly\nlarger than those of the chiral primary \ufb01elds. A simple example is the d = 4, N = 1\nsuperconformal algebra (which has a U(1) R-symmetry group); in this case a chiral\nmultiplet (annihilated by Q) which is a primary is also a chiral primary, and the algebra\ncan be used to prove that the dimension of the scalar component of such multiplets\nis \u2206= 3\n2R where R is the U(1) R-charge. A detailed description of the structure of\nchiral primaries in the d = 4, N = 4 algebra will appear in section 3.2.\nWhen the R-symmetry group is Abelian, we \ufb01nd a bound of the form \u2206\u2265a|R|\nfor some constant a, ensuring that there is no singularity in the OPE of two chiral\n(\u2206= aR) or anti-chiral (\u2206= a|R| = \u2212aR) operators. On the other hand, when\nthe R-symmetry group is non-Abelian, singularities can occur in the OPEs of chiral\noperators, and are avoided only when the product lies in particular representations.\n2.2\nAnti-de Sitter Space\n2.2.1\nGeometry of Anti-de Sitter Space\nIn this section, we will review some geometric facts about anti-de Sitter space. One\nof the important facts is the relation between the conformal compacti\ufb01cations of AdS\nand of \ufb02at space.\nIn the case of the Euclidean signature metric, it is well-known\nthat the \ufb02at space Rn can be compacti\ufb01ed to the n-sphere Sn by adding a point at\nin\ufb01nity, and a conformal \ufb01eld theory is naturally de\ufb01ned on Sn. On the other hand,\nthe (n+1)-dimensional hyperbolic space, which is the Euclidean version of AdS space,\ncan be conformally mapped into the (n + 1)-dimensional disk Dn+1. Therefore the\nboundary of the compacti\ufb01ed hyperbolic space is the compacti\ufb01ed Euclid space. A\nsimilar correspondence holds in the case with the Lorentzian signature metric, as we\nwill see below.\nConformal Structure of Flat Space\nOne of the basic features of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the identi\ufb01cation of the\nisometry group of AdSp+2 with the conformal symmetry of \ufb02at Minkowski space R1,p.\nTherefore, it would be appropriate to start our discussion by reviewing the conformal\n36\n\n\nstructure of \ufb02at space.\n\u25e6R1,1\nWe begin with two-dimensional Minkowski space R1,1:\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + dx2,\n(\u2212\u221e< t, x < +\u221e).\n(2.10)\nThis metric can be rewritten by the following coordinate transformations\nds2\n=\n\u2212du+du\u2212,\n(u\u00b1 = t \u00b1 x)\n=\n1\n4 cos2 \u02dcu+ cos2 \u02dcu\u2212\n(\u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03b82) ,\n(u\u00b1 = tan \u02dcu\u00b1; \u02dcu\u00b1 = (\u03c4 \u00b1 \u03b8)/2).(2.11)\nIn this way, the Minkowski space is conformally mapped into the interior of the com-\npact region, |\u02dcu\u00b1| < \u03c0/2, as shown in \ufb01gure 2.1. Since light ray trajectories are invariant\nunder a conformal rescaling of the metric, this provides a convenient way to express\nthe causal structure of R1,1. The new coordinates (\u03c4, \u03b8) are well de\ufb01ned at the asymp-\ntotical regions of the \ufb02at space. Therefore, the conformal compacti\ufb01cation is used to\ngive a rigorous de\ufb01nition of asymptotic \ufb02atness of spacetime \u2014 a spacetime is called\nasymptotically \ufb02at if it has the same boundary structure as that of the \ufb02at space after\nconformal compacti\ufb01cation.\n\u2212\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c4\n\u03b8\nx=const\nt=const\nFigure 2.1: Two-dimensional Minkowski space is conformally mapped into the interior\nof the rectangle.\nThe two corners of the rectangle at (\u03c4, \u03b8) = (0, \u00b1\u03c0) correspond to the spatial in\ufb01nities\nx = \u00b1\u221ein the original coordinates.

It was proven\nby L\u00a8uscher and Mack [91] that correlation functions of a conformal \ufb01eld theory (CFT)\non R1,1 can be analytically continued to the entire cylinder.\nAs we saw in section 2.1, the global conformal symmetry of R1,1 is SO(2, 2), which\nis generated by the 6 conformal Killing vectors \u2202\u00b1, u\u00b1\u2202\u00b1, u2\n\u00b1\u2202\u00b1.

The generator H = J0,p+2 corresponds to the SO(2)\npart of the maximally compact subgroup SO(2) \u00d7 SO(p + 1) of SO(2, p + 1). Thus\nthe subgroup SO(2) \u00d7 SO(p + 1) (or to be precise its universal cover) of the conformal\ngroup SO(2, p + 1) can be identi\ufb01ed with the isometry of the Einstein static universe\nR \u00d7 Sp. The existence of the generator H also guarantees that a correlation function\nof a CFT on R1,p can be analytically extended to the entire Einstein static universe\nR \u00d7 Sp.\n\u03c1=\n\u03c1=\n8\n8\n\u03c4\nFigure 2.4: AdSp+2 is realized as a hyperboloid in R2,p+1. The hyperboloid has closed\ntimelike curves along the \u03c4 direction. To obtain a causal space, we need to unwrap the\ncircle to obtain a simply connected space.\nAnti-de Sitter Space\nThe (p + 2)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space (AdSp+2) can be represented as the hy-\nperboloid\nX2\n0 + X2\np+2 \u2212\np+1\nX\ni=1\nX2\ni = R2,\n(2.20)\nin the \ufb02at (p + 3)-dimensional space with metric\nds2 = \u2212dX2\n0 \u2212dX2\np+2 +\np+1\nX\ni=1\ndX2\ni .\n(2.21)\nBy construction, the space has the isometry SO(2, p + 1), and it is homogeneous and\nisotropic.\n40\n\n\nEquation (2.20) can be solved by setting\nX0\n=\nR cosh \u03c1 cos \u03c4,\nXp+2 = R cosh \u03c1 sin \u03c4,\nXi\n=\nR sinh \u03c1 \u2126i\n(i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, p + 1;\nX\ni\n\u21262\ni = 1).\n(2.22)\nSubstituting this into (2.21), we obtain the metric on AdSp+2 as\nds2 = R2(\u2212cosh2 \u03c1 d\u03c4 2 + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1 d\u21262).\n(2.23)\nBy taking 0 \u2264\u03c1 and 0 \u2264\u03c4 < 2\u03c0 the solution (2.22) covers the entire hyperboloid once.\nTherefore, (\u03c4, \u03c1, \u2126i) are called the global coordinates of AdS. Since the metric behaves\nnear \u03c1 = 0 as ds2 \u2243R2(\u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u21262), the hyperboloid has the topology of\nS1 \u00d7 Rp+1, with S1 representing closed timelike curves in the \u03c4 direction. To obtain a\ncausal spacetime, we can simply unwrap the circle S1 (i.e. take \u2212\u221e< \u03c4 < \u221ewith\nno identi\ufb01cations) and obtain the universal covering of the hyperboloid without closed\ntimelike curves. In this paper, when we refer to AdSp+2, we only consider this universal\ncovering space.\nThe isometry group SO(2, p + 1) of AdSp+2 has the maximal compact subgroup\nSO(2) \u00d7 SO(p + 1). From the above construction, it is clear that the SO(2) part\nrepresents the constant translation in the \u03c4 direction, and the SO(p+1) gives rotations\nof Sp.\nS2\n\u03c4\n\u2126\n\u03b8=0\n\u03b8=\u03c0/2\nFigure 2.5: AdS3 can be conformally mapped into one half of the Einstein static universe\nR \u00d7 S2.\nTo study the causal structure of AdSp+2, it is convenient to introduce a coordinate\n41\n\n\n\u03b8 related to \u03c1 by tan \u03b8 = sinh \u03c1 (0 \u2264\u03b8 < \u03c0/2). The metric (2.23) then takes the form\nds2 =\nR2\ncos2 \u03b8(\u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u21262).\n(2.24)\nThe causal structure of the spacetime does not change by a conformal rescaling on the\nmetric. Multiplying the metric by R\u22122 cos2 \u03b8, it becomes\nds\u20322 = \u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u21262.\n(2.25)\nThis is the metric of the Einstein static universe, which also appeared, with the dimen-\nsion lower by one, in the conformal compacti\ufb01cation of R1,p (2.15). This time, however,\nthe coordinate \u03b8 takes values in 0 \u2264\u03b8 < \u03c0/2, rather than 0 \u2264\u03b8 < \u03c0 in (2.15). Namely,\nAdSp+2 can be conformally mapped into one half of the Einstein static universe; the\nspacelike hypersurface of constant \u03c4 is a (p + 1)-dimensional hemisphere. The equator\nat \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is a boundary of the space with the topology of Sp, as shown in \ufb01gure 2.5\nin the case of p = 1. (In the case of AdS2, the coordinate \u03b8 ranges \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264\u03b8 \u2264\u03c0/2\nsince S0 consists of two points.) As in the case of the \ufb02at space discussed earlier, the\nconformal compacti\ufb01cation is a convenient way to describe the asymptotic regions of\nAdS. In general, if a spacetime can be conformally compacti\ufb01ed into a region which has\nthe same boundary structure as one half of the Einstein static universe, the spacetime\nis called asymptotically AdS.\nSince the boundary extends in the timelike direction labeled by \u03c4, we need to specify\na boundary condition on the R \u00d7 Sp at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 in order to make the Cauchy problem\nwell-posed on AdS [98]. It turns out that the boundary of AdSp+2, or to be precise the\nboundary of the conformally compacti\ufb01ed AdSp+2, is identical to the conformal com-\npacti\ufb01cation of the (p + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space. This fact plays an essential\nrole in the AdSp+2/CFTp+1 correspondence.\nIn addition to the global parametrization (2.22) of AdS, there is another set of\ncoordinates (u, t,\u20d7x) (0 < u,\u20d7x \u2208Rp) which will be useful later. It is de\ufb01ned by\nX0\n=\n1\n2u\n\u0010\n1 + u2(R2 + \u20d7x 2 \u2212t2)\n\u0011\n,\nXp+2 = Rut,\nXi\n=\nRuxi\n(i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, p),\nXp+1\n=\n1\n2u\n\u0010\n1 \u2212u2(R2 \u2212\u20d7x 2 + t2)\n\u0011\n.\n(2.26)\nThese coordinates cover one half of the hyperboloid (2.20), as shown in \ufb01gure 2.6 in\nthe case of p = 0. Substituting this into (2.21), we obtain another form of the AdSp+2\nmetric\nds2 = R2\n du2\nu2 + u2(\u2212dt2 + d\u20d7x 2)\n!\n.\n(2.27)\n42\n\n\nu=const\n/2\n\u03c0\nu=\nu=0\n8\n-\n\u03b8=\n\u03b8= \u03c0/2\nFigure 2.6: AdS2 can be conformally mapped into R \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]. The (u, t) coordi-\nnates cover the triangular region.\nThe coordinates (u, t,\u20d7x) are called the Poincar\u00b4e coordinates. In this form of the metric,\nthe subgroups ISO(1, p) and SO(1, 1) of the SO(2, p+1) isometry are manifest, where\nISO(1, p) is the Poincar\u00b4e transformation on (t,\u20d7x) and SO(1, 1) is\n(t,\u20d7x, u) \u2192(ct, c\u20d7x, c\u22121u),\nc > 0.\n(2.28)\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence, this is identi\ufb01ed with the dilatation D in the confor-\nmal symmetry group of R1,p.\nIt is useful to compare the two expressions, (2.23) and (2.27), for the metric of\nAdSp+2. In (2.23), the norm of the timelike Killing vector \u2202\u03c4 is everywhere non-zero.\nIn particular, it has a constant norm in the conformally rescaled metric (2.24). For this\nreason, \u03c4 is called the global time coordinate of AdS. On the other hand, the timelike\nKilling vector \u2202t in (2.27) becomes null at u = 0 (Killing horizon), as depicted in \ufb01gure\n2.7 in the AdS2 case.\nEuclidean Rotation\nSince AdSp+2 has the global time coordinate \u03c4 and the metric (2.23) is static with\nrespect to \u03c4, quantum \ufb01eld theory on AdSp+2 (with an appropriate boundary condition\nat spatial in\ufb01nity) allows the Wick rotation in \u03c4, ei\u03c4H \u2192e\u2212\u03c4EH. From (2.22), one\n\ufb01nds that the Wick rotation \u03c4 \u2192\u03c4E = \u2212i\u03c4 is expressed in the original coordinates\n43\n\n\nu=0\n\u03c4\nt\n\u03b8=\u03c0/2\n\u03b8=\u2212\u03c0/2\nFigure 2.7: The timelike Killing vector \u2202t is depicted in the AdS2 case. The vector \u2202t\nbecomes a null vector at u = 0.\n(X0, \u20d7X, Xp+2) on the hyperboloid as Xp+2 \u2192XE = \u2212iXp+2, and the space becomes\nX2\n0 \u2212X2\nE \u2212\u20d7X2 = R2,\nds2\nE = \u2212dX2\n0 + dX2\nE + d \u20d7X2.\n(2.29)\nWe should point out that the same space is obtained by rotating the time coordinate\nt of the Poincar\u00b4e coordinates (2.26) as t \u2192tE = \u2212it, even though the Poincar\u00b4e\ncoordinates cover only a part of the entire AdS (half of the hyperboloid).\nThis is\nanalogous to the well-known fact in \ufb02at Minkowski space that the Euclidean rotation of\nthe time coordinate t in the Rindler space ds2 = \u2212r2dt2 + dr2 gives the \ufb02at Euclidean\nplane R2, even though the Rindler coordinates (t, r) cover only a 1/4 of the entire\nMinkowski space R1,1.\nIn the coordinates (\u03c1, \u03c4E, \u20d7\u2126p) and (u, tE,\u20d7x), the Euclidean metric is expressed as\nds2\nE\n=\nR2 \u0010\ncosh2 \u03c1 d\u03c4 2\nE + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1 d\u21262\np\n\u0011\n=\nR2\n du2\nu2 + u2(dt2\nE + d\u20d7x2)\n!\n.\n(2.30)\nIn the following, we also use another, trivially equivalent, form of the metric, obtained\nfrom the above by setting u = 1/y in (2.30), giving\nds2 = R2\n dy2 + dx2\n1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dx2\np+1\ny2\n!\n.\n(2.31)\n44\n\n\nRe z\ndzdz- \n(Im z)2\n8\nu=\nu=const\nu=0\nFigure 2.8: The Euclidean AdS2 is the upper half plane with the Poincar\u00b4e metric. It\ncan be mapped into a disk, where the in\ufb01nity of the upper half plane is mapped to a\npoint on the boundary of the disk.\nThe Euclidean AdSp+2 is useful for various practical computations in \ufb01eld theory.\nFor theories on \ufb02at space, it is well-known that correlation functions \u27e8\u03c61 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6n\u27e9of \ufb01elds\non the Euclidean space are related, by the Wick rotation, to the T-ordered correlation\nfunctions \u27e80|T(\u03c61 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6n)|0\u27e9in the Minkowski space. The same is true in the anti-de\nSitter space if the theory has a positive de\ufb01nite Hamiltonian with respect to the global\ntime coordinate \u03c4. Green functions of free \ufb01elds on AdSp+2 have been computed in\n[99, 100] using this method.\nThe Euclidean AdSp+2 can be mapped into a (p+2)-dimensional disk. In the coordi-\nnates (u, tE,\u20d7x), u = \u221eis the sphere Sp+1 at the boundary with one point removed. The\nfull boundary sphere is recovered by adding a point corresponding to u = 0 (or equiv-\nalently \u20d7x = \u221e). This is shown in \ufb01gure 2.8 in the case of AdS2, for which z = tE + i/u\ngives a complex coordinate on the upper-half plane. By adding a point at in\ufb01nity, the\nupper-half plane is compacti\ufb01ed into a disk. In the Lorentzian case, u = 0 represented\nthe Killing horizon giving the boundary of the (u, t,\u20d7x) coordinates. Since the u = 0\nplane is null in the Lorentzian case, it shrinks to a point in the Euclidean case.\n2.2.2\nParticles and Fields in Anti-de Sitter Space\nMassive particles, moving along geodesics, can never get to the boundary of AdS. On\nthe other hand, since the Penrose diagram of AdS is a cylinder, light rays can go to the\nboundary and back in \ufb01nite time, as observed by an observer moving along a geodesic\nin AdS. More precisely, the light ray will re\ufb02ect if suitable boundary conditions are set\n45\n\n\nfor the \ufb01elds propagating in AdS.\nLet us \ufb01rst consider the case of a scalar \ufb01eld propagating in AdSp+2.\nThe \ufb01eld\nequation\n\u0010\n\u2206\u2212m2\u0011\n\u03c6 = 0\n(2.32)\nhas stationary wave solutions\n\u03c6 = ei\u03c9\u03c4G(\u03b8)Yl(\u2126p),\n(2.33)\nwhere Yl(\u2126p) is a spherical harmonic, which is an eigenstate of the Laplacian on Sp\nwith an eigenvalue l(l + p \u22121), and G(\u03b8) is given by the hypergeometric function\nG(\u03b8) = (sin \u03b8)l(cos \u03b8)\u03bb\u00b1 2F1 (a, b, c; sin \u03b8) ,\n(2.34)\nwith\na\n=\n1\n2(l + \u03bb\u00b1 \u2212\u03c9R),\nb\n=\n1\n2(l + \u03bb\u00b1 + \u03c9R),\nc\n=\nl + 1\n2(p + 1),\n(2.35)\nand\n\u03bb\u00b1 = 1\n2(p + 1) \u00b1 1\n2\nq\n(p + 1)2 + 4(mR)2.\n(2.36)\nThe energy-momentum tensor\nT\u00b5\u03bd = 2\u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2202\u03bd\u03c6 \u2212g\u00b5\u03bd\n\u0010\n(\u2202\u03c6)2 + m2\u03c62\u0011\n+ \u03b2(g\u00b5\u03bd\u2206\u2212D\u00b5D\u03bd + R\u00b5\u03bd)\u03c62\n(2.37)\nis conserved for any constant value of \u03b2. The value of \u03b2 is determined by the coupling\nof the scalar curvature to \u03c62, which on AdS has the same e\ufb00ect as the mass term in\nthe wave equation (2.32). The choice of \u03b2 for each scalar \ufb01eld depends on the theory\nwe are considering. The total energy E of the scalar \ufb01eld \ufb02uctuation,\nE =\nZ\ndp+1x\u221a\u2212gT 0\n0 ,\n(2.38)\nis conserved only if the energy-momentum \ufb02ux through the boundary at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2\nvanishes,\nZ\nSp d\u2126p\n\u221agniT i\n0|\u03b8=\u03c0/2 = 0.\n(2.39)\nThis requirement reduces to the boundary condition\n(tan \u03b8)p [(1 \u22122\u03b2)\u2202\u03b8 + 2\u03b2 tan \u03b8] \u03c62 \u21920\n(\u03b8 \u2192\u03c0/2).\n(2.40)\n46\n\n\nGoing back to the stationary wave solution (2.34), this is satis\ufb01ed if and only if either\na or b in (2.34) is an integer. If we require the energy \u03c9 to be real, we \ufb01nd\n|\u03c9|R = \u03bb\u00b1 + l + 2n,\n(n = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7).\n(2.41)\nThis is possible only when \u03bb de\ufb01ned by (2.36) is real.\nConsequently, the mass is\nbounded from below as\n\u22121\n4(p + 1)2 \u2264m2R2.\n(2.42)\nThis is known as the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound [101, 102]. Note that a negative\n(mass)2 is allowed to a certain extent. The Compton wavelength for these possible\ntachyons is comparable to the curvature radius of AdS. If m2 > \u2212(p \u22121)(p + 3)/4R2,\nwe should choose \u03bb+ in (2.41) since this solution is normalizable while the solution\nwith \u03bb\u2212is not. If m2 \u2264\u2212(p\u22121)(p+3)/4R2, both solutions are normalizable and there\nare two di\ufb00erent quantizations of the scalar \ufb01eld on AdS space. Which quantization to\nchoose is often determined by requiring symmetry. See [102, 103, 104] for discussions of\nboundary conditions in supersymmetric theories. In general, all solutions to the wave\nequation form a single SO(2, p + 1) highest weight representation. The highest weight\nstate is the lowest energy solution [105]. Since SO(2, p + 1) acts on AdS as isometries,\nthe action of its generators on the solutions is given by \ufb01rst order di\ufb00erential operators.\n2.2.3\nSupersymmetry in Anti-de Sitter Space\nThe SO(2, p + 1) isometry group of AdSp+2 has a supersymmetric generalization called\nan AdS supergroup. To understand the supersymmetry on AdS, it would be useful to\nstart with the simple supergravity with a cosmological constant \u039b. In four dimensions,\nfor example, the action of the N = 1 theory is [106]\nS =\nZ\nd4x\n\u0012\n\u2212\u221ag(R \u22122\u039b) + 1\n2\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u00af\u03c8\u00b5\u03b35\u03b3\u03bd \u02dcD\u03c1\u03c8\u03c3\n\u0013\n,\n(2.43)\nwhere\n\u02dcD\u00b5 = D\u00b5 + i\n2\ns\n\u039b\n3 \u03b3\u00b5\n(2.44)\nand D\u00b5 is the standard covariant derivative. The local supersymmetry transformation\nrules for the vierbein Va\u00b5 and the gravitino \u03c8\u00b5 are\n\u03b4Va\u00b5\n=\n\u2212i\u00af\u01eb(x)\u03b3a\u03c8\u00b5,\n\u03b4\u03c8\u00b5\n=\n\u02dcD\u00b5\u01eb(x).\n(2.45)\nA global supersymmetry of a given supergravity background is determined by re-\nquiring that the gravitino variation is annihilated, \u03b4\u03c8\u00b5 = 0. The resulting condition\n47\n\n\non \u01eb(x),\n\u02dcD\u00b5\u01eb =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edD\u00b5 + i\n2\ns\n\u039b\n3 \u03b3\u00b5\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\u01eb = 0,\n(2.46)\nis known as the Killing spinor equation. The integrability of this equation requires\n[ \u02dcD\u00b5, \u02dcD\u03bd]\u01eb = 1\n2(R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3 \u22122\n3\u039b\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd)\u01eb = 0,\n(2.47)\nwhere\n\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd = 1\n2\u03b3[\u00b5,\u03b3\u03bd].\n(2.48)\nSince AdS is maximally symmetric, the curvature obeys\nR\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 1\nR2(g\u00b5\u03c1g\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212g\u00b5\u03c3g\u03bd\u03c1) ,\n(2.49)\nwhere R is the size of the hyperboloid de\ufb01ned by (2.20).\nThus, if we choose the\ncurvature of AdS to be \u039b = 3/R2 (this is necessary for AdS to be a classical solution of\n(2.43)), the integrability condition (2.47) is obeyed for any spinor \u01eb. Since the Killing\nspinor equation (2.46) is a \ufb01rst order equation, this means that there are as many\nsolutions to the equation as the number of independent components of the spinor.\nNamely, AdS preserves as many supersymmetries as \ufb02at space.\nThe existence of supersymmetry implies that, with an appropriate set of boundary\nconditions, the supergravity theory on AdS is stable with its energy bounded from\nbelow. The supergravity theories on AdS typically contains scalar \ufb01elds with negative\n(mass)2. However they all satisfy the bound (2.42) [104, 107]. The issue of the boundary\ncondition and supersymmetry in AdS was further studied in [103]. A non-perturbative\nproof of the stability of AdS is given in [108], based on a generalization of Witten\u2019s\nproof [109] of the positive energy theorem in \ufb02at space [110].\n2.2.4\nGauged Supergravities and Kaluza-Klein Compacti\ufb01ca-\ntions\nExtended supersymmetries in AdSp+2 with p = 2, 3, 4, 5 are classi\ufb01ed by Nahm [92]\n(see also [111]) as\nAdS4\n:\nOSp(N |4), N = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nAdS5\n:\nSU(2, 2|N /2),\nN = 2, 4, 6, 8\nAdS6\n:\nF(4)\nAdS7\n:\nOSp(6, 2|N ), N = 2, 4.\n(2.50)\n48\n\n\nFor AdSp+2 with p > 5, there is no simple AdS supergroup. These extended super-\nsymmetries are realized as global symmetries of gauged supergravity on AdSp+2. The\nAdS/CFT correspondence identi\ufb01es them with the superconformal algebras discussed\nin section 2.1.3.\nGauged supergravities are supergravity theories with non-abelian\ngauge \ufb01elds in the supermultiplet of the graviton. Typically the cosmological constant\nis negative and AdSp+2 is a natural background geometry. Many of them are related\nto Kaluza-Klein compacti\ufb01cation of the supergravities in 10 and 11 dimensions. A\ncomplete catalogue of gauged supergravities in dimensions \u226411 is found in [21]. Here\nwe list some of them.\n\u25e6AdS7\nThe gauged supergravity in 7 dimensions has global supersymmetry OSp(6, 2|N ).\nThe maximally supersymmetric case of N = 4 constructed in [112] contains a Yang-\nMills \ufb01eld with a gauge group Sp(2) \u2243SO(5). The \ufb01eld content of this theory can be\nderived from a truncation of the spectrum of the Kaluza-Klein compacti\ufb01cation of the\n11-dimensional supergravity to 7 dimensions,\nR11 \u2192AdS7 \u00d7 S4.\n(2.51)\nThe 11-dimensional supergravity has the Lagrangian\nL = \u221ag\n\u00121\n4R \u22121\n48F\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n\u0013\n+ 1\n72A \u2227F \u2227F + fermions,\n(2.52)\nwhere A is a 3-form gauge \ufb01eld and F = dA. It was pointed out by Freund and Rubin\n[113] that there is a natural way to \u201ccompactify\u201d the theory to 4 or 7 dimensions. We\nhave put the word \u201ccompactify\u201d in quotes since we will see that typically the size of\nthe compact dimensions is comparable to the radius of curvature of the non-compact\ndimensions.\nTo compactify the theory to 7 dimensions, the ansatz of Freund and\nRubin sets the 4-form \ufb01eld strength F to be proportional to the volume element on a\n4-dimensional subspace M4. The Einstein equation, which includes the contribution of\nF to the energy-momentum tensor, implies a positive curvature on M4 and a constant\nnegative curvature on the non-compact dimensions, i.e. they are AdS7.\nThe maximally symmetric case is obtained by considering M4 = S4. Since there is\nno cosmological constant in 11 dimensions, the radius R of S4 is proportional to the\ncurvature radius of AdS7. By the Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the SO(5) isometry of S4\nbecomes the gauge symmetry in 7 dimensions. The spherical harmonics on S4 give\nan in\ufb01nite tower of Kaluza-Klein particles on AdS7. A truncation of this spectrum\nto include only the graviton supermultiplet gives the spectrum of the N = 4 SO(5)\ngauged supergravity on AdS7. It has been believed that this is a consistent truncation\nof the full theory, and very recently it was shown in [114] that this is indeed the case.\nIn general, there are subtleties in the consistent truncation procedure, which will be\n49\n\n\ndiscussed in more detail in the next subsection. There are also other N = 4 theories\nwith non-compact gauge groups SO(p, q) with p + q = 5 [115].\nThe seven dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity with gauge group Sp(1) \u2243SU(2)\nwas constructed in [116]. In this case, one can have also a matter theory with possibly\nanother gauge group G.\nIt is not known whether a matter theory of arbitrary G\nwith arbitrary coupling constant can be coupled to gauged supergravity. The Kaluza-\nKlein compacti\ufb01cation of 10-dimensional N = 1 supergravity, coupled to N = 1 super\nYang-Mills, on S3 gives a particular example. In this case, ten dimensional anomaly\ncancellation requires particular choices of G.\n\u25e6AdS6\nThe 6-dimensional anti-de Sitter supergroup F(4) is realized by the N = 4 gauged\nsupergravity with gauge group SU(2). It was predicted to exist in [117] and constructed\nin [118]. It was conjectured in [119] to be related to a compacti\ufb01cation of the ten\ndimensional massive type IIA supergravity theory. The relevant compacti\ufb01cation of\nthe massive type IIA supergravity is constructed as a \ufb01bration of AdS6 over S4 [120].\nThe form of the ten dimensional space is called a warped product [121] and it is the\nmost general one that has the AdS isometry group [122]. The SU(2) gauge group of\nthe 6-dimensional N = 4 gauged supergravity is associated with an SU(2) subgroup\nof the SO(4) isometry group of the compact part of the ten dimensional space.\n\u25e6AdS5\nIn 5 dimensions, there are N = 2, 4, 6 and 8 gauged supergravities with supersym-\nmetry SU(2, 2|N /2). The gauged N = 8 supergravity was constructed in [123, 124]. It\nhas the gauge group SU(4) \u2243SO(6) and the global symmetry E6. This theory can be\nderived by a truncation of the compacti\ufb01cation of 10-dimensional type IIB supergravity\non S5 using the Freund-Rubin ansatz, i.e. setting the self-dual 5-form \ufb01eld strength\nF (5) to be proportional to the volume form of S5 [125, 85, 126]. By the Einstein equa-\ntion, the strength of F (5) determines the radius of S5 and the cosmological constant\nR\u22122 of AdS5.\nThis case is of particular interest; as we will see below, the AdS/CFT correspondence\nclaims that it is dual to the large N (and large g2\nY MN) limit of N = 4 supersymmetric\nSU(N) gauge theory in four dimensions. The complete Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum\nof the IIB supergravity theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 was obtained in [85, 126]. One of the\ninteresting features of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum (in this case as well as in the other\ncases discussed in this section) is that the frequency \u03c9 of stationary wave solutions is\nquantized. For example, the masses of the scalar \ufb01elds in the Kaluza-Klein tower are\nall of the form (mR)2 = \u02dcl(\u02dcl+4), where \u02dcl is an integer bounded from below. Substituting\nthis into (2.36) with p = 3, we obtain\n\u03bb\u00b1 = 2 \u00b1 |\u02dcl + 2|.\n(2.53)\n50\n\n\nTherefore, the frequency \u03c9 given by (2.41) takes values in integer multiples of 1/R:\n|\u03c9|R = 2 \u00b1 |\u02dcl + 2| + l + 2n,\n(n = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7).\n(2.54)\nThis means that all the scalar \ufb01elds in the supergravity multiplet are periodic in \u03c4\nwith the period 2\u03c0, i.e. the scalar \ufb01elds are single-valued on the original hyperboloid\n(2.20) before taking the universal covering.\nThis applies to all other \ufb01elds in the\nsupermultiplet as well, with the fermions obeying the Ramond boundary condition\naround the timelike circle.\nThe fact that the frequency \u03c9 is quantized has its origin in supersymmetry. The\nsupergravity particles in 10 dimensions are BPS objects and preserve one half of the\nsupersymmetry. This property is preserved under the Kaluza-Klein compacti\ufb01cation\non S5. The notion of the BPS particles in the case of AdS supergravity is clari\ufb01ed in\n[127] and it is shown, in the context of theories in 4 dimensions, that it leads to the\nquantization of \u03c9. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, this is dual to the fact that chiral\nprimary operators do not have anomalous dimensions.\nOn the other hand, energy levels of other states, such as stringy states or black holes,\nare not expected to be quantized as the supergravity modes are. Thus, the full string\ntheory does not make sense on the hyperboloid but only on its universal cover without\nthe closed timelike curve.\nThe N = 4 gauged supergravity with gauge group SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) was constructed in\n[128]. Various N = 2 theories were constructed in [129, 130, 131, 132].\n\u25e6AdS4\nIn four dimensions, some of the possible AdS supergroups are OSp(N |4) with N =\n1, 2, 4 and 8. N = 8 is the maximal supergroup that corresponds to a supergravity\ntheory. The N = 8 gauged supergravity with SO(8) gauge group was constructed in\n[133, 134]. This theory (like the other theories discussed in this section) has a highly\nnon-trivial potential for scalar \ufb01elds, whose extrema were analyzed in [135, 136]. It\nwas shown in [137] that the extremum with N = 8 supersymmetry corresponds to\na truncation of the compacti\ufb01cation of 11-dimensional supergravity on AdS4 \u00d7 S7.\nSome of the other extrema can also be identi\ufb01ed with truncations of compacti\ufb01cations\nof the 11-dimensional theory. For a review of the 4-dimensional compacti\ufb01cations of\n11-dimensional supergravity, see [22].\n\u25e6AdS3\nNahm\u2019s classi\ufb01cation does not include this case since the isometry group SO(2, 2) of\nAdS3 is not a simple group but rather the direct product of two SL(2, R) factors. The\nsupergravity theories associated with the AdS3 supergroups OSp(p|2)\u00d7OSp(q|2) were\nconstructed in [138] and studied more recently in [139]. They can be regarded as the\nChern-Simons gauge theories of gauge group OSp(p|2) \u00d7 OSp(q|2). Therefore, they\n51\n\n\nare topological \ufb01eld theories without local degrees of freedom. The case of p = q = 3\nis obtained, for example, by a truncation of the Kaluza-Klein compacti\ufb01cation of the\n6-dimensional N = (2, 0) supergravity on S3. In addition to OSp(p|2), several other\nsupersymmetric extensions of SL(2, R) are known, such as:\nSU(N |1, 1), G(3), F(4), D(2, 1, \u03b1).\n(2.55)\nTheir representations are studied extensively in the context of two-dimensional super-\nconformal \ufb01eld theories.\n2.2.5\nConsistent Truncation of Kaluza-Klein Compacti\ufb01cations\nDespite the fact that the equations of motion for type IIB supergravity in ten dimen-\nsions are known, it turns out to be di\ufb03cult to extract any simple form for the equations\nof motion of \ufb02uctuations around its \ufb01ve-dimensional Kaluza-Klein compacti\ufb01cation on\nS5. The spectrum of this compacti\ufb01cation is known from the work of [126, 85]. It is\na general feature of compacti\ufb01cations involving anti-de Sitter space that the positively\ncurved compact part has a radius of curvature on the same order as the negatively\ncurved anti-de Sitter part. As a result, the positive (mass)2 of Kaluza-Klein modes is\nof the same order as the negative (mass)2 of tachyonic modes. Thus there is no low-\nenergy limit in which one can argue that all but \ufb01nitely many Kaluza-Klein harmonics\ndecouple. This was a traditional worry for all compacti\ufb01cations of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity on squashed seven-spheres.\nHowever, fairly compelling evidence exists ([140] and references therein) that the\nreduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on S7 can be consistently truncated to\nfour-dimensional N = 8 gauged supergravity. This is an exact statement about the\nequations of motion, and does not rely in any way on taking a low-energy limit. Put\nsimply, it means that any solution of the truncated theory can be lifted to a solution of\nthe untruncated theory. Charged black hole metrics in anti-de Sitter space provide a\nnon-trivial example of solutions that can be lifted to the higher-dimensional theory [141,\n142, 143]. There is a belief but no proof that a similar truncation may be made from ten-\ndimensional type IIB supergravity on S5 to \ufb01ve-dimensional N = 8 supergravity. To\nillustrate how radical a truncation this is, we indicate in \ufb01gure 2.9 the \ufb01ve-dimensional\nscalars that are kept (this is a part of one of the \ufb01gures in [126]).\nNote that not\nall of them are SO(6) singlets.\nIndeed, the \ufb01elds which are kept are precisely the\nsuperpartners of the massless graviton under the supergroup SU(2, 2|4), which includes\nSO(6) as its R-symmetry group.\nThe historical route to gauged supergravities was as an elaboration of the ungauged\ntheories, and only after the fact were they argued to be related to the Kaluza-Klein\nreduction of higher dimensional theories on positively curved manifolds.

The \ufb01lled dots indicate \ufb01elds which are kept in the truncation to\ngauged supergravity. We also indicate schematically the ten-dimensional origin of the\nscalars.\nd = 5 N = 8 supergravity, the scalars parametrize the coset E6(6)/USp(8) (following\n[144] we use here USp(8) to denote the unitary version of the symplectic group with a\nfour-dimensional Cartan subalgebra). The spectrum of gauged supergravity is almost\nthe same: the only di\ufb00erence is that twelve of the vector \ufb01elds are dualized into anti-\nsymmetric two-forms. Schematically, we write this as\ng\u00b5\u03bd\n\u03c8a\n\u00b5\nAab\n\u00b5\n\u03c7abc\n\u03c6abcd\n1\n8\n27\n48\n42\n@\n\u0000A\u00b5 IJ B I\u03b1\n\u00b5\u03bd\n15\n12\n(2.56)\nLower-case Roman indices are the eight-valued indices of the fundamental of USp(8).\nMultiple USp(8) indices in (2.56) are antisymmetrized and the symplectic trace parts\nremoved. The upper-case Roman indices I, J are the six-valued indices of the vector\nrepresentation of SO(6), while the index \u03b1 indicates a doublet of the SL(2, R) which\ndescends directly from the SL(2, R) global symmetry of type IIB supergravity. These\ngroups are embedded into E6(6) via the chain\nE6(6) \u2283SL(6, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) \u2283SO(6) \u00d7 SL(2, R) .\n(2.57)\nThe key step in formulating gauged supergravities is to introduce minimal gauge\ncouplings into the Lagrangian for all \ufb01elds which are charged under the subgroup of\nthe global symmetry group that is to be gauged. For instance, if XI is a scalar \ufb01eld in\nthe vector representation of SO(6), one makes the replacement\n\u2202\u00b5XI \u2192D\u00b5XI = \u2202\u00b5XI \u2212gA\u00b5 IJXJ\n(2.58)\n53\n\n\neverywhere in the ungauged action. The gauge coupling g has dimensions of energy\nin \ufb01ve dimensions, and one can eventually show that g = 2/R where R is the radius\nof the S5 in the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 geometry. The replacement (2.58) spoils supersymmetry,\nbut it was shown in [124, 123] that a supersymmetric Lagrangian can be recovered\nby adding terms at O(g) and O(g2).\nThe full Lagrangian and the supersymmetry\ntransformations can be found in these references. It is a highly non-trivial claim that\nthis action, with its beautiful non-polynomial structure in the scalar \ufb01elds, represents\na consistent truncation of the reduction of type IIB supergravity on S5. This is not\nentirely implausible, in view of the fact that the SO(6) isometry of the S5 becomes\nthe local gauge symmetry of the truncated theory.\nTrivial examples of consistent\ntruncation include situations where one restricts to \ufb01elds which are invariant under\nsome subgroup of the gauge group. For instance, the part of N = 8 \ufb01ve-dimensional\nsupergravity invariant under a particular SU(2) \u2282SO(6) is N = 4 gauged supergravity\ncoupled to two tensor multiplets [145]. A similar trunction to N = 6 supergravity was\nconsidered in [146].\nThe O(g2) term in the Lagrangian is particularly interesting: it is a potential V\nfor the scalars. V is an SO(6) \u00d7 SL(2, R) invariant function on the coset manifold\nE6(6)/USp(8). It involves all the 42 scalars except the dilaton and the axion. Roughly\nspeaking, one can think of the 40 remaining scalars as parametrizing a restricted class\nof deformations of the metric and 3-form \ufb01elds on the S5, and of V as measuring the\nresponse of type IIB supergravity to these deformations. If the scalars are frozen to an\nextremum of V , then the value of the potential sets the cosmological constant in \ufb01ve\ndimensions. The associated conformal \ufb01eld theories were discussed in [147, 148, 149].\nThe known extrema can be classi\ufb01ed by the subset of the SO(6) global R-symmetry\ngroup that is preserved.\n54\n\n\nChapter 3\nAdS/CFT Correspondence\n3.1\nThe Correspondence\nIn this section we will present an argument connecting type IIB string theory compact-\ni\ufb01ed on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 to N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory [5]. Let us start with type IIB\nstring theory in \ufb02at, ten dimensional Minkowski space. Consider N parallel D3 branes\nthat are sitting together or very close to each other (the precise meaning of \u201cvery close\u201d\nwill be de\ufb01ned below). The D3 branes are extended along a (3 + 1) dimensional plane\nin (9 + 1) dimensional spacetime. String theory on this background contains two kinds\nof perturbative excitations, closed strings and open strings. The closed strings are the\nexcitations of empty space and the open strings end on the D-branes and describe exci-\ntations of the D-branes. If we consider the system at low energies, energies lower than\nthe string scale 1/ls, then only the massless string states can be excited, and we can\nwrite an e\ufb00ective Lagrangian describing their interactions. The closed string massless\nstates give a gravity supermultiplet in ten dimensions, and their low-energy e\ufb00ective\nLagrangian is that of type IIB supergravity. The open string massless states give an\nN = 4 vector supermultiplet in (3 + 1) dimensions, and their low-energy e\ufb00ective\nLagrangian is that of N = 4 U(N) super-Yang-Mills theory [9, 2].\nThe complete e\ufb00ective action of the massless modes will have the form\nS = Sbulk + Sbrane + Sint.\n(3.1)\nSbulk is the action of ten dimensional supergravity, plus some higher derivative cor-\nrections. Note that the Lagrangian (3.1) involves only the massless \ufb01elds but it takes\ninto account the e\ufb00ects of integrating out the massive \ufb01elds. It is not renormalizable\n(even for the \ufb01elds on the brane), and it should only be understood as an e\ufb00ective\ndescription in the Wilsonian sense, i.e. we integrate out all massive degrees of freedom\nbut we do not integrate out the massless ones. The brane action Sbrane is de\ufb01ned on\nthe (3 + 1) dimensional brane worldvolume, and it contains the N = 4 super-Yang-\n55\n\n\nMills Lagrangian plus some higher derivative corrections, for example terms of the\nform \u03b1\u20322Tr(F 4). Finally, Sint describes the interactions between the brane modes and\nthe bulk modes. The leading terms in this interaction Lagrangian can be obtained by\ncovariantizing the brane action, introducing the background metric for the brane [150].\nWe can expand the bulk action as a free quadratic part describing the propagation\nof free massless modes (including the graviton), plus some interactions which are pro-\nportional to positive powers of the square root of the Newton constant. Schematically\nwe have\nSbulk \u223c\n1\n2\u03ba2\nZ \u221agR \u223c\nZ\n(\u2202h)2 + \u03ba(\u2202h)2h + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n(3.2)\nwhere we have written the metric as g = \u03b7 +\u03bah. We indicate explicitly the dependence\non the graviton, but the other terms in the Lagrangian, involving other \ufb01elds, can be\nexpanded in a similar way. Similarly, the interaction Lagrangian Sint is proportional to\npositive powers of \u03ba. If we take the low energy limit, all interaction terms proportional\nto \u03ba drop out. This is the well known fact that gravity becomes free at long distances\n(low energies).\nIn order to see more clearly what happens in this low energy limit it is convenient\nto keep the energy \ufb01xed and send ls \u21920 (\u03b1\u2032 \u21920) keeping all the dimensionless\nparameters \ufb01xed, including the string coupling constant and N.\nIn this limit the\ncoupling \u03ba \u223cgs\u03b1\u20322 \u21920, so that the interaction Lagrangian relating the bulk and the\nbrane vanishes. In addition all the higher derivative terms in the brane action vanish,\nleaving just the pure N = 4 U(N) gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions, which is known\nto be a conformal \ufb01eld theory. And, the supergravity theory in the bulk becomes free.\nSo, in this low energy limit we have two decoupled systems. On the one hand we have\nfree gravity in the bulk and on the other hand we have the four dimensional gauge\ntheory.\nNext, we consider the same system from a di\ufb00erent point of view. D-branes are\nmassive charged objects which act as a source for the various supergravity \ufb01elds. As\nshown in section 1.3 we can \ufb01nd a D3 brane solution [58] of supergravity, of the form\nds2 = f \u22121/2(\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2 + dx2\n3) + f 1/2(dr2 + r2d\u21262\n5) ,\nF5 = (1 + \u2217)dtdx1dx2dx3df \u22121 ,\nf = 1 + R4\nr4 ,\nR4 \u22614\u03c0gs\u03b1\u20322N .\n(3.3)\nNote that since gtt is non-constant, the energy Ep of an object as measured by an\nobserver at a constant position r and the energy E measured by an observer at in\ufb01nity\nare related by the redshift factor\nE = f \u22121/4Ep .\n(3.4)\n56\n\n\nThis means that the same object brought closer and closer to r = 0 would appear to\nhave lower and lower energy for the observer at in\ufb01nity. Now we take the low energy\nlimit in the background described by equation (3.3). There are two kinds of low energy\nexcitations (from the point of view of an observer at in\ufb01nity). We can have massless\nparticles propagating in the bulk region with wavelengths that becomes very large, or\nwe can have any kind of excitation that we bring closer and closer to r = 0. In the\nlow energy limit these two types of excitations decouple from each other. The bulk\nmassless particles decouple from the near horizon region (around r = 0) because the\nlow energy absorption cross section goes like \u03c3 \u223c\u03c93R8 [10, 11], where \u03c9 is the energy.\nThis can be understood from the fact that in this limit the wavelength of the particle\nbecomes much bigger than the typical gravitational size of the brane (which is of order\nR). Similarly, the excitations that live very close to r = 0 \ufb01nd it harder and harder to\nclimb the gravitational potential and escape to the asymptotic region. In conclusion,\nthe low energy theory consists of two decoupled pieces, one is free bulk supergravity\nand the second is the near horizon region of the geometry. In the near horizon region,\nr \u226aR, we can approximate f \u223cR4/r4, and the geometry becomes\nds2 = r2\nR2(\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2 + dx2\n3) + R2dr2\nr2 + R2d\u21262\n5,\n(3.5)\nwhich is the geometry of AdS5 \u00d7 S5.\nWe see that both from the point of view of a \ufb01eld theory of open strings living\non the brane, and from the point of view of the supergravity description, we have\ntwo decoupled theories in the low-energy limit. In both cases one of the decoupled\nsystems is supergravity in \ufb02at space. So, it is natural to identify the second system\nwhich appears in both descriptions. Thus, we are led to the conjecture that N = 4\nU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory in 3+1 dimensions is the same as (or dual to) type IIB\nsuperstring theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 [5].\nWe could be a bit more precise about the near horizon limit and how it is being\ntaken. Suppose that we take \u03b1\u2032 \u21920, as we did when we discussed the \ufb01eld theory\nliving on the brane. We want to keep \ufb01xed the energies of the objects in the throat\n(the near-horizon region) in string units, so that we can consider arbitrary excited\nstring states there. This implies that\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032Ep \u223c\ufb01xed. For small \u03b1\u2032 (3.4) reduces to\nE \u223cEpr/\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032. Since we want to keep \ufb01xed the energy measured from in\ufb01nity, which\nis the way energies are measured in the \ufb01eld theory, we need to take r \u21920 keeping\nr/\u03b1\u2032 \ufb01xed. It is then convenient to de\ufb01ne a new variable U \u2261r/\u03b1\u2032, so that the metric\nbecomes\nds2 = \u03b1\u2032\n\"\nU2\n\u221a4\u03c0gsN (\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2 + dx2\n3) +\nq\n4\u03c0gsN dU2\nU2 +\nq\n4\u03c0gsNd\u21262\n5\n#\n.\n(3.6)\nThis can also be seen by considering a D3 brane sitting at \u20d7r. As discussed in section\n57\n\n\n1.3 this corresponds to giving a vacuum expectation value to one of the scalars in the\nYang-Mills theory. When we take the \u03b1\u2032 \u21920 limit we want to keep the mass of the\n\u201cW-boson\u201d \ufb01xed. This mass, which is the mass of the string stretching between the\nbranes sitting at \u20d7r = 0 and the one at \u20d7r, is proportional to U = r/\u03b1\u2032, so this quantity\nshould remain \ufb01xed in the decoupling limit.\nA U(N) gauge theory is essentially equivalent to a free U(1) vector multiplet times\nan SU(N) gauge theory, up to some ZN identi\ufb01cations (which a\ufb00ect only global issues).\nIn the dual string theory all modes interact with gravity, so there are no decoupled\nmodes. Therefore, the bulk AdS theory is describing the SU(N) part of the gauge\ntheory. In fact we were not precise when we said that there were two sets of excitations\nat low energies, the excitations in the asymptotic \ufb02at space and the excitations in\nthe near horizon region.\nThere are also some zero modes which live in the region\nconnecting the \u201cthroat\u201d (the near horizon region) with the bulk, which correspond to\nthe U(1) degrees of freedom mentioned above. The U(1) vector supermultiplet includes\nsix scalars which are related to the center of mass motion of all the branes [151]. From\nthe AdS point of view these zero modes live at the boundary, and it looks like we might\nor might not decide to include them in the AdS theory. Depending on this choice we\ncould have a correspondence to an SU(N) or a U(N) theory. The U(1) center of mass\ndegree of freedom is related to the topological theory of B-\ufb01elds on AdS [152]; if one\nimposes local boundary conditions for these B-\ufb01elds at the boundary of AdS one \ufb01nds\na U(1) gauge \ufb01eld living at the boundary [153], as is familiar in Chern-Simons theories\n[25, 154].\nThese modes living at the boundary are sometimes called singletons (or\ndoubletons) [155, 127, 156, 87, 88, 157, 158, 159, 160].\nAs we saw in section 2.2, Anti-de-Sitter space has a large group of isometries, which\nis SO(4, 2) for the case at hand. This is the same group as the conformal group in 3+1\ndimensions. Thus, the fact that the low-energy \ufb01eld theory on the brane is conformal\nis re\ufb02ected in the fact that the near horizon geometry is Anti-de-Sitter space. We also\nhave some supersymmetries. The number of supersymmetries is twice that of the full\nsolution (3.3) containing the asymptotic region [151]. This doubling of supersymmetries\nis viewed in the \ufb01eld theory as a consequence of superconformal invariance (section\n2.2.3), since the superconformal algebra has twice as many fermionic generators as the\ncorresponding Poincare superalgebra. We also have an SO(6) symmetry which rotates\nthe S5. This can be identi\ufb01ed with the SU(4)R R-symmetry group of the \ufb01eld theory.\nIn fact, the whole supergroup is the same for the N = 4 \ufb01eld theory and the AdS5 \u00d7S5\ngeometry, so both sides of the conjecture have the same spacetime symmetries. We\nwill discuss in more detail the matching between the two sides of the correspondence\nin section 3.2.\nIn the above derivation the \ufb01eld theory is naturally de\ufb01ned on R3,1, but we saw\nin section 2.2.1 that we could also think of the conformal \ufb01eld theory as de\ufb01ned on\n58\n\n\nS3 \u00d7 R by rede\ufb01ning the Hamiltonian.\nSince the isometries of AdS are in one to\none correspondence with the generators of the conformal group of the \ufb01eld theory, we\ncan conclude that this new Hamiltonian 1\n2(P0 + K0) can be associated on AdS to the\ngenerator of translations in global time. This formulation of the conjecture is more\nuseful since in the global coordinates there is no horizon. When we put the \ufb01eld theory\non S3 the Coulomb branch is lifted and there is a unique ground state. This is due\nto the fact that the scalars \u03c6I in the \ufb01eld theory are conformally coupled, so there is\na term of the form\nR d4xTr(\u03c62)R in the Lagrangian, where R is the curvature of the\nfour-dimensional space on which the theory is de\ufb01ned. Due to the positive curvature\nof S3 this leads to a mass term for the scalars [20], lifting the moduli space.\nThe parameter N appears on the string theory side as the \ufb02ux of the \ufb01ve-form\nRamond-Ramond \ufb01eld strength on the S5,\nZ\nS5 F5 = N.\n(3.7)\nFrom the physics of D-branes we know that the Yang-Mills coupling is related to the\nstring coupling through [6, 161]\n\u03c4 \u22614\u03c0i\ng2\nY M\n+ \u03b8\n2\u03c0 = i\ngs\n+ \u03c7\n2\u03c0 ,\n(3.8)\nwhere we have also included the relationship of the \u03b8 angle to the expectation value\nof the RR scalar \u03c7. We have written the couplings in this fashion because both the\ngauge theory and the string theory have an SL(2, Z) self-duality symmetry under which\n\u03c4 \u2192(a\u03c4 + b)/(c\u03c4 + d) (where a, b, c, d are integers with ad \u2212bc = 1). In fact, SL(2, Z)\nis a conjectured strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of type IIB string theory in\n\ufb02at space [162], and it should also be a symmetry in the present context since all the\n\ufb01elds that are being turned on in the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background (the metric and the \ufb01ve\nform \ufb01eld strength) are invariant under this symmetry. The connection between the\nSL(2, Z) duality symmetries of type IIB string theory and N = 4 SYM was noted in\n[163, 164, 165]. The string theory seems to have a parameter that does not appear\nin the gauge theory, namely \u03b1\u2032, which sets the string tension and all other scales in\nthe string theory. However, this is not really a parameter in the theory if we do not\ncompare it to other scales in the theory, since only relative scales are meaningful. In\nfact, only the ratio of the radius of curvature to \u03b1\u2032 is a parameter, but not \u03b1\u2032 and\nthe radius of curvature independently. Thus, \u03b1\u2032 will disappear from any \ufb01nal physical\nquantity we compute in this theory. It is sometimes convenient, especially when one is\ndoing gravity calculations, to set the radius of curvature to one. This can be achieved\nby writing the metric as ds2 = R2d\u02dcs2, and rewriting everything in terms of \u02dcg. With\nthese conventions GN \u223c1/N2 and \u03b1\u2032 \u223c1/\u221agsN. This implies that any quantity\ncalculated purely in terms of the gravity solution, without including stringy e\ufb00ects,\n59\n\n\nwill be independent of gsN and will depend only on N. \u03b1\u2032 corrections to the gravity\nresults give corrections which are proportional to powers of 1/\u221agsN.\nNow, let us address the question of the validity of various approximations.\nThe\nanalysis of loop diagrams in the \ufb01eld theory shows that we can trust the perturbative\nanalysis in the Yang-Mills theory when\ng2\nY MN \u223cgsN \u223cR4\nl4\ns\n\u226a1.\n(3.9)\nNote that we need g2\nY MN to be small and not just g2\nY M.\nOn the other hand, the\nclassical gravity description becomes reliable when the radius of curvature R of AdS\nand of S5 becomes large compared to the string length,\nR4\nl4s\n\u223cgsN \u223cg2\nY MN \u226b1.\n(3.10)\nWe see that the gravity regime (3.10) and the perturbative \ufb01eld theory regime (3.9)\nare perfectly incompatible. In this fashion we avoid any obvious contradiction due\nto the fact that the two theories look very di\ufb00erent.\nThis is the reason that this\ncorrespondence is called a \u201cduality\u201d. The two theories are conjectured to be exactly\nthe same, but when one side is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice\nversa. This makes the correspondence both hard to prove and useful, as we can solve\na strongly coupled gauge theory via classical supergravity. Notice that in (3.9)(3.10)\nwe implicitly assumed that gs < 1. If gs > 1 we can perform an SL(2, Z) duality\ntransformation and get conditions similar to (3.9)(3.10) but with gs \u21921/gs.\nSo,\nwe cannot get into the gravity regime (3.10) by taking N small (N = 1, 2, ..) and\ngs very large, since in that case the D-string becomes light and renders the gravity\napproximation invalid. Another way to see this is to note that the radius of curvature\nin Planck units is R4/l4\np \u223cN. So, it is always necessary, but not su\ufb03cient, to have\nlarge N in order to have a weakly coupled supergravity description.\nOne might wonder why the above argument was not a proof rather than a conjecture.\nIt is not a proof because we did not treat the string theory non-perturbatively (not\neven non-perturbatively in \u03b1\u2032). We could also consider di\ufb00erent forms of the conjecture.\nIn its weakest form the gravity description would be valid for large gsN, but the full\nstring theory on AdS might not agree with the \ufb01eld theory. A not so weak form would\nsay that the conjecture is valid even for \ufb01nite gsN, but only in the N \u2192\u221elimit\n(so that the \u03b1\u2032 corrections would agree with the \ufb01eld theory, but the gs corrections\nmay not). The strong form of the conjecture, which is the most interesting one and\nwhich we will assume here, is that the two theories are exactly the same for all values\nof gs and N. In this conjecture the spacetime is only required to be asymptotic to\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5 as we approach the boundary. In the interior we can have all kinds of\n60\n\n\nprocesses; gravitons, highly excited fundamental string states, D-branes, black holes,\netc. Even the topology of spacetime can change in the interior. The Yang-Mills theory\nis supposed to e\ufb00ectively sum over all spacetimes which are asymptotic to AdS5 \u00d7 S5.\nThis is completely analogous to the usual conditions of asymptotic \ufb02atness. We can\nhave black holes and all kinds of topology changing processes, as long as spacetime is\nasymptotically \ufb02at. In this case asymptotic \ufb02atness is replaced by the asymptotic AdS\nbehavior.\n3.1.1\nBrane Probes and Multicenter Solutions\nThe moduli space of vacua of the N = 4 U(N) gauge theory is (R6)N/SN, parametriz-\ning the positions of the N branes in the six dimensional transverse space.\nIn the\nsupergravity solution one can replace\nf \u221dN\nr4 \u2192\nN\nX\ni=1\n1\n|\u20d7r \u2212\u20d7ri|4,\n(3.11)\nand still have a solution to the supergravity equations. We see that if |\u20d7r| \u226b|\u20d7ri| then\nthe two solutions are basically the same, while when we go to r \u223cri the solution starts\nlooking like the solution of a single brane. Of course, we cannot trust the supergravity\nsolution for a single brane (since the curvature in Planck units is proportional to a\nnegative power of N). What we can do is separate the N branes into groups of Ni\nbranes with gsNi \u226b1 for all i. Then we can trust the gravity solution everywhere.\nAnother possibility is to separate just one brane (or a small number of branes)\nfrom a group of N branes. Then we can view this brane as a D3-brane in the AdS5\nbackground which is generated by the other branes (as described above). A string\nstretching between the brane probe and the N branes appears in the gravity description\nas a string stretching between the D3-brane and the horizon of AdS. This seems a bit\nsurprising at \ufb01rst since the proper distance to the horizon is in\ufb01nite. However, we get\na \ufb01nite result for the energy of this state once we remember to include the redshift\nfactor. The D3-branes in AdS (like any D3-branes in string theory) are described at\nlow energies by the Born-Infeld action, which is the Yang-Mills action plus some higher\nderivative corrections. This seems to contradict, at \ufb01rst sight, the fact that the dual\n\ufb01eld theory (coming from the original branes) is just the pure Yang-Mills theory. In\norder to understand this point more precisely let us write explicitly the bosonic part\n61\n\n\nof the Born-Infeld action for a D-3 brane in AdS [150],\nS = \u2212\n1\n(2\u03c0)3gs\u03b1\u20322\nZ\nd4xf \u22121 [\nr\n\u2212det(\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 + f\u2202\u03b1r\u2202\u03b2r + r2fgij\u2202\u03b1\u03b8i\u2202\u03b2\u03b8j + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nq\nfF\u03b1\u03b2) \u22121\n#\n,\nf = 4\u03c0gs\u03b1\u20322N\nr4\n,\n(3.12)\nwhere \u03b8i are angular coordinates on the 5-sphere. We can easily check that if we de\ufb01ne\na new coordinate U = r/\u03b1\u2032, then all the \u03b1\u2032 dependence drops out of this action. Since\nU (which has dimensions of energy) corresponds to the mass of the W bosons in this\ncon\ufb01guration, it is the natural way to express the Higgs expectation value that breaks\nU(N +1) to U(N)\u00d7U(1). In fact, the action (3.12) is precisely the low-energy e\ufb00ective\naction in the \ufb01eld theory for the massless U(1) degrees of freedom, that we obtain after\nintegrating out the massive degrees of freedom (W bosons). We can expand (3.12)\nin powers of \u2202U and we see that the quadratic term does not have any correction,\nwhich is consistent with the non-renormalization theorem for N = 4 super-Yang-Mills\n[166]. The (\u2202U)4 term has only a one-loop correction, and this is also consistent with\nanother non-renormalization theorem [167]. This one-loop correction can be evaluated\nexplicitly in the gauge theory and the result agrees with the supergravity result [168].\nIt is possible to argue, using broken conformal invariance, that all terms in (3.12) are\ndetermined by the (\u2202U)4 term [5]. Since the massive degrees of freedom that we are\nintegrating out have a mass proportional to U, the action (3.12) makes sense as long\nas the energies involved are much smaller than U. In particular, we need \u2202U/U \u226aU.\nSince (3.12) has the form L(gsN(\u2202U)2/U4), the higher order terms in (3.12) could\nbecome important in the supergravity regime, when gsN \u226b1. The Born Infeld action\n(3.12), as always, makes sense only when the curvature of the brane is small, but the\ndeviations from a straight \ufb02at brane could be large. In this regime we can keep the\nnon-linear terms in (3.12) while we still neglect the massive string modes and similar\ne\ufb00ects. Further gauge theory calculations for e\ufb00ective actions of D-brane probes include\n[169, 170, 171].\n3.1.2\nThe Field \u2194Operator Correspondence\nA conformal \ufb01eld theory does not have asymptotic states or an S-matrix, so the natural\nobjects to consider are operators. For example, in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills we have a\ndeformation by a marginal operator which changes the value of the coupling constant.\nChanging the coupling constant in the \ufb01eld theory is related by (3.8) to changing the\ncoupling constant in the string theory, which is then related to the expectation value of\n62\n\n\nthe dilaton. The expectation value of the dilaton is set by the boundary condition for\nthe dilaton at in\ufb01nity. So, changing the gauge theory coupling constant corresponds\nto changing the boundary value of the dilaton. More precisely, let us denote by O\nthe corresponding operator. We can consider adding the term\nR d4x\u03c60(\u20d7x)O(\u20d7x) to the\nLagrangian (for simplicity we assume that such a term was not present in the original\nLagrangian, otherwise we consider \u03c60(\u20d7x) to be the total coe\ufb03cient of O(\u20d7x) in the\nLagrangian).\nAccording to the discussion above, it is natural to assume that this\nwill change the boundary condition of the dilaton at the boundary of AdS to (in the\ncoordinate system (2.31)) \u03c6(\u20d7x, z)|z=0 = \u03c60(\u20d7x). More precisely, as argued in [19, 20], it\nis natural to propose that\n\u27e8e\nR\nd4x\u03c60(\u20d7x)O(\u20d7x)\u27e9CF T = Zstring\n\"\n\u03c6(\u20d7x, z)\n\f\f\fz=0 = \u03c60(\u20d7x)\n#\n,\n(3.13)\nwhere the left hand side is the generating function of correlation functions in the \ufb01eld\ntheory, i.e. \u03c60 is an arbitrary function and we can calculate correlation functions of O\nby taking functional derivatives with respect to \u03c60 and then setting \u03c60 = 0. The right\nhand side is the full partition function of string theory with the boundary condition\nthat the \ufb01eld \u03c6 has the value \u03c60 on the boundary of AdS. Notice that \u03c60 is a function\nof the four variables parametrizing the boundary of AdS5.\nA formula like (3.13) is valid in general, for any \ufb01eld \u03c6. Therefore, each \ufb01eld prop-\nagating on AdS space is in a one to one correspondence with an operator in the \ufb01eld\ntheory. There is a relation between the mass of the \ufb01eld \u03c6 and the scaling dimension\nof the operator in the conformal \ufb01eld theory. Let us describe this more generally in\nAdSd+1. The wave equation in Euclidean space for a \ufb01eld of mass m has two indepen-\ndent solutions, which behave like zd\u2212\u2206and z\u2206for small z (close to the boundary of\nAdS), where\n\u2206= d\n2 +\ns\nd2\n4 + R2m2.\n(3.14)\nTherefore, in order to get consistent behavior for a massive \ufb01eld, the boundary condi-\ntion on the \ufb01eld in the right hand side of (3.13) should in general be changed to\n\u03c6(\u20d7x, \u01eb) = \u01ebd\u2212\u2206\u03c60(\u20d7x),\n(3.15)\nand eventually we would take the limit where \u01eb \u21920. Since \u03c6 is dimensionless, we\nsee that \u03c60 has dimensions of [length]\u2206\u2212d which implies, through the left hand side\nof (3.13), that the associated operator O has dimension \u2206(3.14). A more detailed\nderivation of this relation will be given in section 3.3, where we will verify that the\ntwo-point correlation function of the operator O behaves as that of an operator of\ndimension \u2206[19, 20]. A similar relation between \ufb01elds on AdS and operators in the\n63\n\n\n\ufb01eld theory exists also for non-scalar \ufb01elds, including fermions and tensors on AdS\nspace.\nCorrelation functions in the gauge theory can be computed from (3.13) by di\ufb00erenti-\nating with respect to \u03c60. Each di\ufb00erentiation brings down an insertion O, which sends\na \u03c6 particle (a closed string state) into the bulk. Feynman diagrams can be used to\ncompute the interactions of particles in the bulk. In the limit where classical super-\ngravity is applicable, the only diagrams that contribute are the tree-level diagrams of\nthe gravity theory (see for instance \ufb01gure 3.1).\nFigure 3.1: Correlation functions can be calculated (in the large gsN limit) in terms of\nsupergravity Feynman diagrams. Here we see the leading contribution coming from a\ndisconnected diagram plus connected pieces involving interactions of the supergravity\n\ufb01elds in the bulk of AdS. At tree level, these diagrams and those related to them by\ncrossing are the only ones that contribute to the four-point function.\nThis method of de\ufb01ning the correlation functions of a \ufb01eld theory which is dual to\na gravity theory in the bulk of AdS space is quite general, and it applies in principle\nto any theory of gravity [20]. Any local \ufb01eld theory contains the stress tensor as an\noperator. Since the correspondence described above matches the stress-energy tensor\nwith the graviton, this implies that the AdS theory includes gravity. It should be\na well de\ufb01ned quantum theory of gravity since we should be able to compute loop\ndiagrams. String theory provides such a theory. But if a new way of de\ufb01ning quantum\ngravity theories comes along we could consider those gravity theories in AdS, and they\nshould correspond to some conformal \ufb01eld theory \u201con the boundary\u201d. In particular,\nwe could consider backgrounds of string theory of the form AdS5 \u00d7 M5 where M5 is\nany Einstein manifold [172, 173, 174]. Depending on the choice of M5 we get di\ufb00erent\ndual conformal \ufb01eld theories, as discussed in section 4.1. Similarly, this discussion\ncan be extended to any AdSd+1 space, corresponding to a conformal \ufb01eld theory in d\nspacetime dimensions (for d > 1). We will discuss examples of this in section 6.1.\n64\n\n\n3.1.3\nHolography\nIn this section we will describe how the AdS/CFT correspondence gives a holographic\ndescription of physics in AdS spaces.\nLet us start by explaining the Bekenstein bound, which states that the maximum\nentropy in a region of space is Smax = Area/4GN [29], where the area is that of the\nboundary of the region. Suppose that we had a state with more entropy than Smax,\nthen we show that we could violate the second law of thermodynamics. We can throw\nin some extra matter such that we form a black hole. The entropy should not decrease.\nBut if a black hole forms inside the region its entropy is just the area of its horizon,\nwhich is smaller than the area of the boundary of the region (which by our assumption\nis smaller than the initial entropy). So, the second law has been violated.\nNote that this bound implies that the number of degrees of freedom inside some\nregion grows as the area of the boundary of a region and not like the volume of the\nregion. In standard quantum \ufb01eld theories this is certainly not possible. Attempting\nto understand this behavior leads to the \u201cholographic principle\u201d, which states that in\na quantum gravity theory all physics within some volume can be described in terms of\nsome theory on the boundary which has less than one degree of freedom per Planck\narea [27, 28] (so that its entropy satis\ufb01es the Bekenstein bound).\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence we are describing physics in the bulk of AdS space\nby a \ufb01eld theory of one less dimension (which can be thought of as living on the\nboundary), so it looks like holography. However, it is hard to check what the number\nof degrees of freedom per Planck area is, since the theory, being conformal, has an\nin\ufb01nite number of degrees of freedom, and the area of the boundary of AdS space is\nalso in\ufb01nite. Thus, in order to compare things properly we should introduce a cuto\ufb00\non the number of degrees of freedom in the \ufb01eld theory and see what it corresponds to\nin the gravity theory. For this purpose let us write the metric of AdS as\nds2 = R2\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u2212\n 1 + r2\n1 \u2212r2\n!2\ndt2 +\n4\n(1 \u2212r2)2(dr2 + r2d\u21262)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb.\n(3.16)\nIn these coordinates the boundary of AdS is at r = 1. We saw above that when we\ncalculate correlation functions we have to specify boundary conditions at r = 1\u2212\u03b4 and\nthen take the limit of \u03b4 \u21920. It is clear by studying the action of the conformal group\non Poincar\u00b4e coordinates that the radial position plays the role of some energy scale,\nsince we approach the boundary when we do a conformal transformation that localizes\nobjects in the CFT. So, the limit \u03b4 \u21920 corresponds to going to the UV of the \ufb01eld\ntheory. When we are close to the boundary we could also use the Poincar\u00b4e coordinates\nds2 = R2\u2212dt2 + d\u20d7x2 + dz2\nz2\n,\n(3.17)\n65\n\n\nin which the boundary is at z = 0. If we consider a particle or wave propagating\nin (3.17) or (3.16) we see that its motion is independent of R in the supergravity\napproximation. Furthermore, if we are in Euclidean space and we have a wave that\nhas some spatial extent \u03bb in the \u20d7x directions, it will also have an extent \u03bb in the z\ndirection. This can be seen from (3.17) by eliminating \u03bb through the change of variables\nx \u2192\u03bbx, z \u2192\u03bbz. This implies that a cuto\ufb00at\nz \u223c\u03b4\n(3.18)\ncorresponds to a UV cuto\ufb00in the \ufb01eld theory at distances \u03b4, with no factors of R (\u03b4\nhere is dimensionless, in the \ufb01eld theory it is measured in terms of the radius of the S4\nor S3 that the theory lives on). Equation (3.18) is called the UV-IR relation [175].\nConsider the case of N = 4 SYM on a three-sphere of radius one. We can estimate\nthe number of degrees of freedom in the \ufb01eld theory with a UV cuto\ufb00\u03b4. We get\nS \u223cN2\u03b4\u22123,\n(3.19)\nsince the number of cells into which we divide the three-sphere is of order 1/\u03b43. In the\ngravity solution (3.16) the area in Planck units of the surface at r = 1 \u2212\u03b4, for \u03b4 \u226a1,\nis\nArea\n4GN\n= VS5R3\u03b4\u22123\n4GN\n\u223cN2\u03b4\u22123.\n(3.20)\nThus, we see that the AdS/CFT correspondence saturates the holographic bound [175].\nOne could be a little suspicious of the statement that gravity in AdS is holographic,\nsince it does not seem to be saying much because in AdS space the volume and the\nboundary area of a given region scale in the same fashion as we increase the size of\nthe region. In fact, any \ufb01eld theory in AdS would be holographic in the sense that\nthe number of degrees of freedom within some (large enough) volume is proportional\nto the area (and also to the volume).\nWhat makes this case di\ufb00erent is that we\nhave the additional parameter R, and then we can take AdS spaces of di\ufb00erent radii\n(corresponding to di\ufb00erent values of N in the SYM theory), and then we can ask\nwhether the number of degrees of freedom goes like the volume or the area, since these\nhave a di\ufb00erent dependence on R.\nOne might get confused by the fact that the surface r = 1 \u2212\u03b4 is really nine dimen-\nsional as opposed to four dimensional. From the form of the full metric on AdS5 \u00d7 S5\nwe see that as we take \u03b4 \u21920 the physical size of four of the dimensions of this nine\ndimensional space grow, while the other \ufb01ve, the S5, remain constant.\nSo, we see\nthat the theory on this nine dimensional surface becomes e\ufb00ectively four dimensional,\nsince we need to multiply the metric by a factor that goes to zero as we approach the\nboundary in order to de\ufb01ne a \ufb01nite metric for the four dimensional gauge theory.\n66\n\n\nNote that even though it is often said that the \ufb01eld theory is de\ufb01ned on the boundary\nof AdS, it actually describes all the physics that is going on inside AdS. When we are\nthinking in the AdS picture it is incorrect to consider at the same time an additional\n\ufb01eld theory living at the boundary1. Di\ufb00erent regions of AdS space, which are at\ndi\ufb00erent radial positions, correspond to physics at di\ufb00erent energy scales in the \ufb01eld\ntheory.\nIt is interesting that depending on what boundary we take, R3+1 (in the\nPoincar\u00b4e coordinates) or S3 \u00d7 R (in the global coordinates), we can either have a\nhorizon or not have one. The presence of a horizon in the R3+1 case is related to the\nfact that the theory has no mass gap and we can have excitations at arbitrarily low\nenergies. This will always happen when we have a horizon, since by bringing a particle\nclose to a horizon its energy becomes arbitrarily small. We are talking about the energy\nmeasured with respect to the time associated to the Killing vector that vanishes at the\nhorizon. In the S3 case there is no horizon, and correspondingly the theory has a gap.\nIn this case the \ufb01eld theory has a discrete spectrum since it is in \ufb01nite volume.\nL\nR\nR max\n(L)\nFigure 3.2: Derivation of the IR/UV relation by considering a spatial geodesic ending\nat two points on the boundary.\nNow let us consider the UV/IR correspondence in spaces that are not AdS, like the\nones which correspond to the \ufb01eld theories living on D-p-branes with p \u0338= 3 (see section\n6.1.3). A simple derivation involves considering a classical spatial geodesic that ends\non the boundary at two points separated by a distance L in \ufb01eld theory units (see\n\ufb01gure 3.2). This geodesic goes into the bulk, and it has a point at which the distance\nto the boundary is maximal. Let us call this point rmax(L). Then, one formulation of\nthe UV/IR relation is\nr = rmax(L) \u2194L.\n(3.21)\nA similar criterion arises if we consider the wave equation instead of classical geodesics\n1Except possibly for a small number of singleton \ufb01elds.\n67\n\n\n[176]; of course both are the same since a classical geodesic arises as a limit of the wave\nequation for very massive particles.\nSince the radial direction arises holographically, it is not obvious at \ufb01rst sight that\nthe theory will be causal in the bulk. Issues of causality in the holographic description\nof the spacetime physics were discussed in [177, 178, 179, 180].\nThis holographic description has implications for the physics of black holes. This\ndescription should therefore explain how the singularity inside black holes should be\ntreated (see [181]). Holography also implies that black hole evolution is unitary since\nthe boundary theory is unitary. It is not totally clear, from the gravity point of view,\nhow the information comes back out or where it is stored (see [182] for a discussion).\nSome speculations about holography and a new uncertainty principle were discussed\nin [183].\n3.2\nTests of the AdS/CFT Correspondence\nIn this section we review the direct tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In section\n3.1 we saw how string theory on AdS de\ufb01nes a partition function which can be used\nto de\ufb01ne a \ufb01eld theory. Here we will review the evidence showing that this \ufb01eld theory\nis indeed the same as the conjectured dual \ufb01eld theory. We will focus here only on\ntests of the correspondence between the N = 4 SU(N) SYM theory and the type\nIIB string theory compacti\ufb01ed on AdS5 \u00d7 S5; most of the tests described here can be\ngeneralized also to cases in other dimensions and/or with less supersymmetry, which\nwill be described below.\nAs described in section 3.1, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a strong/weak coupling\nduality. In the \u2019t Hooft large N limit, it relates the region of weak \ufb01eld theory coupling\n\u03bb = g2\nY MN in the SYM theory to the region of high curvature (in string units) in the\nstring theory, and vice versa. Thus, a direct comparison of correlation functions is\ngenerally not possible, since (with our current knowledge) we can only compute most\nof them perturbatively in \u03bb on the \ufb01eld theory side and perturbatively in 1/\n\u221a\n\u03bb on the\nstring theory side. For example, as described below, we can compute the equation of\nstate of the SYM theory and also the quark-anti-quark potential both for small \u03bb and\nfor large \u03bb, and we obtain di\ufb00erent answers, which we do not know how to compare\nsince we can only compute them perturbatively on both sides. A similar situation\narises also in many \ufb01eld theory dualities that were analyzed in the last few years (such\nas the electric/magnetic SL(2, Z) duality of the N = 4 SYM theory itself), and it was\nrealized that there are several properties of these theories which do not depend on the\ncoupling, so they can be compared to test the duality. These are:\n\u2022 The global symmetries of the theory, which cannot change as we change the\n68\n\n\ncoupling (except for extreme values of the coupling). As discussed in section\n3.1, in the case of the AdS/CFT correspondence we have the same supergroup\nSU(2, 2|4) (whose bosonic subgroup is SO(4, 2)\u00d7SU(4)) as the global symmetry\nof both theories. Also, both theories are believed to have a non-perturbative\nSL(2, Z) duality symmetry acting on their coupling constant \u03c4. These are the\nonly symmetries of the theory on R4. Additional ZN symmetries arise when the\ntheories are compacti\ufb01ed on non-simply-connected manifolds, and these were also\nsuccessfully matched in [184, 152]2.\n\u2022 Some correlation functions, which are usually related to anomalies, are protected\nfrom any quantum corrections and do not depend on \u03bb. The matching of these\ncorrelation functions will be described in section 3.2.2 below.\n\u2022 The spectrum of chiral operators does not change as the coupling varies, and it\nwill be compared in section 3.2.1 below.\n\u2022 The moduli space of the theory also does not depend on the coupling. In the\nSU(N) \ufb01eld theory the moduli space is R6(N\u22121)/SN, parametrized by the eigen-\nvalues of six commuting traceless N \u00d7 N matrices. On the AdS side it is not\nclear exactly how to de\ufb01ne the moduli space. As described in section 3.1.1, there\nis a background of string theory corresponding to any point in the \ufb01eld theory\nmoduli space, but it is not clear how to see that this is the exact moduli space\non the string theory side (especially since high curvatures arise for generic points\nin the moduli space).\n\u2022 The qualitative behavior of the theory upon deformations by relevant or marginal\noperators also does not depend on the coupling (at least for chiral operators\nwhose dimension does not depend on the coupling, and in the absence of phase\ntransitions). This will be discussed in section 4.3.\nThere are many more qualitative tests of the correspondence, such as the exis-\ntence of con\ufb01nement for the \ufb01nite temperature theory [185], which we will not\ndiscuss in this section. We will also not discuss here tests involving the behavior\nof the theory on its moduli space [169, 186, 170].\n2Unlike most of the other tests described here, this test actually tests the \ufb01nite N duality and not\njust the large N limit.\n69\n\n\n3.2.1\nThe Spectrum of Chiral Primary Operators\nThe Field Theory Spectrum\nThe N = 4 supersymmetry algebra in d = 4 has four generators QA\n\u03b1 (and their complex\nconjugates \u00afQ \u02d9\u03b1A), where \u03b1 is a Weyl-spinor index (in the 2 of the SO(3, 1) Lorentz\ngroup) and A is an index in the 4 of the SU(4)R R-symmetry group (lower indices A\nwill be taken to transform in the \u00af4 representation).

Such a \ufb01eld theory is equivalent to an N = 2 theory with one hypermultiplet\nin the adjoint representation, or to an N = 1 theory with three chiral multiplets \u03a6i in\nthe adjoint representation (in the 32/3 of the SU(3) \u00d7 U(1)R \u2282SU(4)R which is left\nunbroken by the choice of a single N = 1 SUSY generator) and a superpotential of the\nform W \u221d\u01ebijkTr(\u03a6i\u03a6j\u03a6k). The interactions of the theory include a scalar potential\nproportional to P\nI,J Tr([\u03c6I, \u03c6J]2), such that the moduli space of the theory is the space\nof commuting matrices \u03c6I (I = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 6).\n70\n\n\nThe spectrum of operators in this theory includes all the gauge invariant quantities\nthat can be formed from the \ufb01elds described above.\nIn this section we will focus\non local operators which involve \ufb01elds taken at the same point in space-time.\nFor\nthe SU(N) theory described above, properties of the adjoint representation of SU(N)\ndetermine that such operators necessarily involve a product of traces of products of\n\ufb01elds (or the sum of such products). It is natural to divide the operators into single-\ntrace operators and multiple-trace operators. In the \u2019t Hooft large N limit correlation\nfunctions involving multiple-trace operators are suppressed by powers of N compared\nto those of single-trace operators involving the same \ufb01elds. We will discuss here in\ndetail only the single-trace operators; the multiple-trace operators appear in operator\nproduct expansions of products of single-trace operators.\nAs discussed in section 2.1, it is natural to classify the operators in a conformal\ntheory into primary operators and their descendants. In a superconformal theory it\nis also natural to distinguish between chiral primary operators, which are in short\nrepresentations of the superconformal algebra and are annihilated by some of the su-\npercharges, and non-chiral primary operators. Representations of the superconformal\nalgebra are formed by starting with some state of lowest dimension, which is anni-\nhilated by the operators S and K\u00b5, and acting on it with the operators Q and P\u00b5.\nThe N = 4 supersymmetry algebra involves 16 real supercharges. A generic primary\nrepresentation of the superconformal algebra will thus include 216 primaries of the\nconformal algebra, generated by acting on the lowest state with products of di\ufb00erent\nsupercharges; acting with additional supercharges always leads to descendants of the\nconformal algebra (i.e. derivatives). Since the supercharges have helicities \u00b11/2, the\nprimary \ufb01elds in such representations will have a range of helicities between \u03bb \u22124 (if\nthe lowest dimension operator \u03c8 has helicity \u03bb) and \u03bb + 4 (acting with more than 8\nsupercharges of the same helicity either annihilates the state or leads to a conformal\ndescendant). In non-generic representations of the superconformal algebra a product\nof less than 16 di\ufb00erent Q\u2019s annihilates the lowest dimension operator, and the range\nof helicities appearing is smaller. In particular, in the small representations of the\nN = 4 superconformal algebra only up to 4 Q\u2019s of the same helicity acting on the\nlowest dimension operator give a non-zero result, and the range of helicities is between\n\u03bb \u22122 and \u03bb + 2. For the N = 4 supersymmetry algebra (not including the conformal\nalgebra) it is known that medium representations, whose range of helicities is 6, can\nalso exist (they arise, for instance, on the moduli space of the SU(N) N = 4 SYM\ntheory [188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]); it is not clear if such medium repre-\nsentations of the superconformal algebra [196] can appear in physical theories or not\n(there are no known examples). More details on the structure of representations of the\nN = 4 superconformal algebra may be found in [85, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 196] and\nreferences therein.\n71\n\n\nIn the U(1) N = 4 SYM theory (which is a free theory), the only gauge-invariant\n\u201csingle trace\u201d operators are the \ufb01elds of the vector multiplet itself (which are \u03c6I, \u03bbA, \u00af\u03bbA\nand F\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202[\u00b5A\u03bd]). These operators form an ultra-short representation of the N = 4\nalgebra whose range of helicities is from (\u22121) to 1 (acting with more than two su-\npercharges of the same helicity on any of these states gives either zero or derivatives,\nwhich are descendants of the conformal algebra). All other local gauge invariant op-\nerators in the theory involve derivatives or products of these operators.\nThis rep-\nresentation is usually called the doubleton representation, and it does not appear\nin the SU(N) SYM theory (though the representations which do appear can all be\nformed by tensor products of the doubleton representation). In the context of AdS\nspace one can think of this multiplet as living purely on the boundary of the space\n[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 87, 86, 207, 208, 209, 210], as expected for the U(1) part of\nthe original U(N) gauge group of the D3-branes (see the discussion in section 3.1).\nThere is no known simple systematic way to compute the full spectrum of chiral\nprimary operators of the N = 4 SU(N) SYM theory, so we will settle for presenting the\nknown chiral primary operators. The lowest component of a superconformal-primary\nmultiplet is characterized by the fact that it cannot be written as a supercharge Q\nacting on any other operator. Looking at the action of the supersymmetry charges\n(3.23) suggests that generally operators built from the fermions and the gauge \ufb01elds\nwill be descendants (given by Q acting on some other \ufb01elds), so one would expect\nthe lowest components of the chiral primary representations to be built only from the\nscalar \ufb01elds, and this turns out to be correct.\nLet us analyze the behavior of operators of the form OI1I2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7In \u2261Tr(\u03c6I1\u03c6I2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6In).\nFirst we can ask if this operator can be written as {Q, \u03c8} for any \ufb01eld \u03c8. In the\nSUSY algebra (3.23) only commutators of \u03c6I\u2019s appear on the right hand side, so we see\nthat if some of the indices are antisymmetric the \ufb01eld will be a descendant. Thus, only\nsymmetric combinations of the indices will be lowest components of primary multiplets.\nNext, we should ask if the multiplet built on such an operator is a (short) chiral\nprimary multiplet or not. There are several di\ufb00erent ways to answer this question.\nOne possibility is to use the relation between the dimension of chiral primary operators\nand their R-symmetry representation [94, 95, 96, 93, 97], and to check if this relation\nis obeyed in the free \ufb01eld theory, where [OI1I2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7In] = n. In this way we \ufb01nd that the\nrepresentation is chiral primary if and only if the indices form a symmetric traceless\nproduct of n 6\u2019s (traceless representations are de\ufb01ned as those who give zero when\nany two indices are contracted). This is a representation of weight (0, n, 0) of SU(4)R;\nin this section we will refer to SU(4)R representations either by their dimensions in\nboldface or by their weights.\nAnother way to check this is to see if by acting with Q\u2019s on these operators we get the\nmost general possible states or not, namely if the representation contains \u201cnull vectors\u201d\n72\n\n\nor not (it turns out that in all the relevant cases \u201cnull vectors\u201d appear already at the\n\ufb01rst level by acting with a single Q, though in principle there could be representations\nwhere \u201cnull vectors\u201d appear only at higher levels). Using the SUSY algebra (3.23)\nit is easy to see that for symmetric traceless representations we get \u201cnull vectors\u201d\nwhile for other representations we do not. For instance, let us analyze in detail the\ncase n = 2. The symmetric product of two 6\u2019s is given by 6 \u00d7 6 \u21921 + 20\u2032. The\n\ufb01eld in the 1 representation is Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6I), for which [QA\n\u03b1, Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6I)] \u223cCAJBTr(\u03bb\u03b1B\u03c6J)\nwhere CAIB is a Clebsch-Gordan coe\ufb03cient for \u00af4 \u00d7 6 \u21924.\nThe right-hand side is\nin the 4 representation, which is the most general representation that can appear in\nthe product 4 \u00d7 1, so we \ufb01nd no null vectors at this level. On the other hand, if we\nlook at the symmetric traceless product Tr(\u03c6{I\u03c6J}) \u2261Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6J)\u22121\n6\u03b4IJTr(\u03c6K\u03c6K) in the\n20\u2032 representation, we \ufb01nd that {QA\n\u03b1, Tr(\u03c6{I\u03c6J})} \u223cTr(\u03bb\u03b1B\u03c6K) with the right-hand\nside being in the 20 representation (appearing in \u00af4 \u00d7 6 \u21924 + 20), while the left-hand\nside could in principle be in the 4 \u00d7 20\u2032 \u219220 + 60. Since the 60 does not appear on\nthe right-hand side (it is a \u201cnull vector\u201d) we identify that the representation built on\nthe 20\u2032 is a short representation of the SUSY algebra. By similar manipulations (see\n[20, 211, 197, 200] for more details) one can verify that chiral primary representations\ncorrespond exactly to symmetric traceless products of 6\u2019s.\nIt is possible to analyze the chiral primary spectrum also by using N = 1 subalgebras\nof the N = 4 algebra. If we use an N = 1 subalgebra of the N = 4 algebra, as described\nabove, the operators On include the chiral operators of the form Tr(\u03a6i1\u03a6i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03a6in) (in\na representation of SU(3) which is a symmetric product of 3\u2019s), but for a particular\nchoice of the N = 1 subalgebra not all the operators On appear to be chiral (a short\nmultiplet of the N = 4 algebra includes both short and long multiplets of the N = 1\nsubalgebra).\nThe last issue we should discuss is what is the range of values of n. The product\nof more than N commuting3 N \u00d7 N matrices can always be written as a sum of\nproducts of traces of less than N of the matrices, so it does not form an independent\noperator. This means that for n > N we can express the operator OI1I2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7In in terms\nof other operators, up to operators including commutators which (as explained above)\nare descendants of the SUSY algebra. Thus, we \ufb01nd that the short chiral primary\nrepresentations are built on the operators On = O{I1I2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7In} with n = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, N, for\nwhich the indices are in the symmetric traceless product of n 6\u2019s (in a U(N) theory\nwe would \ufb01nd the same spectrum with the additional representation corresponding to\nn = 1). The superconformal algebra determines the dimension of these \ufb01elds to be\n[On] = n, which is the same as their value in the free \ufb01eld theory. We argued above\n3We can limit the discussion to commuting matrices since, as discussed above, commutators always\nlead to descendants, and we can write any product of matrices as a product of commuting matrices\nplus terms with commutators.\n73\n\n\nthat these are the only short chiral primary representations in the SU(N) gauge theory,\nbut we will not attempt to rigorously prove this here.\nThe full chiral primary representations are obtained by acting on the \ufb01elds On by\nthe generators Q and P of the supersymmetry algebra. The representation built on\nOn contains a total of 256 \u00d7 1\n12n2(n2 \u22121) primary states, of which half are bosonic and\nhalf are fermionic. Since these multiplets are built on a \ufb01eld of helicity zero, they will\ncontain primary \ufb01elds of helicities between (\u22122) and 2. The highest dimension primary\n\ufb01eld in the multiplet is (generically) of the form Q4 \u00afQ4On, and its dimension is n + 4.\nThere is an elegant way to write these multiplets as traces of products of \u201ctwisted\nchiral N = 4 super\ufb01elds\u201d [211, 197]; see also [212] which checks some components of\nthese super\ufb01elds against the couplings to supergravity modes predicted on the basis of\nthe DBI action for D3-branes in anti-de Sitter space [213].\nIt is easy to \ufb01nd the form of all the \ufb01elds in such a multiplet by using the algebra\n(3.23). For example, let us analyze here in detail the bosonic primary \ufb01elds of dimension\nn+ 1 in the multiplet. To get a \ufb01eld of dimension n+ 1 we need to act on On with two\nsupercharges (recall that [Q] = 1\n2). If we act with two supercharges QA\n\u03b1 of the same\nchirality, their Lorentz indices can be either antisymmetrized or symmetrized. In the\n\ufb01rst case we get a Lorentz scalar \ufb01eld in the (2, n \u22122, 0) representation of SU(4)R,\nwhich is of the schematic form\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2{Q\u03b1, [Q\u03b2, On]} \u223c\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2Tr(\u03bb\u03b1A\u03bb\u03b2B\u03c6J1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6Jn\u22122) + Tr([\u03c6K1, \u03c6K2]\u03c6L1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6Ln\u22121). (3.24)\nUsing an N = 1 subalgebra some of these operators may be written as the lowest\ncomponents of the chiral super\ufb01elds Tr(W 2\n\u03b1\u03a6j1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03a6jn\u22122). In the second case we get\nan anti-symmetric 2-form of the Lorentz group, in the (0, n \u22121, 0) representation of\nSU(4)R, of the form\n{Q{\u03b1, [Q\u03b2}, On]} \u223cTr((\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd)\u03b1\u03b2F\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6J1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6Jn\u22121) + Tr(\u03bb\u03b1A\u03bb\u03b2B\u03c6K1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6Kn\u22122).\n(3.25)\nBoth of these \ufb01elds are complex, with the complex conjugate \ufb01elds given by the action\nof two \u00afQ\u2019s. Acting with one Q and one \u00afQ on the state On gives a (real) Lorentz-vector\n\ufb01eld in the (1, n \u22122, 1) representation of SU(4)R, of the form\n{Q\u03b1, [ \u00afQ \u02d9\u03b1, On]} \u223cTr(\u03bb\u03b1A\u00af\u03bbB\n\u02d9\u03b1\u03c6J1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6Jn\u22122) + (\u03c3\u00b5)\u03b1 \u02d9\u03b1Tr((D\u00b5\u03c6J)\u03c6K1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6Kn\u22121).\n(3.26)\nAt dimension n + 2 (acting with four supercharges) we \ufb01nd :\n\u2022 A complex scalar \ufb01eld in the (0, n \u22122, 0) representation, given by Q4On, of the\nform Tr(F 2\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6In\u22122) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.\n\u2022 A real scalar \ufb01eld in the (2, n \u22124, 2) representation, given by Q2 \u00afQ2On, of the\nform \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u01eb \u02d9\u03b1 \u02d9\u03b2Tr(\u03bb\u03b1A1\u03bb\u03b2A2\u00af\u03bbB1\n\u02d9\u03b1 \u00af\u03bbB2\n\u02d9\u03b2 \u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6In\u22124) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.\n74\n\n\n\u2022 A complex vector \ufb01eld in the (1, n\u22124, 1) representation, given by Q3 \u00afQOn, of the\nform Tr(F\u00b5\u03bdD\u03bd\u03c6J\u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6In\u22122) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.\n\u2022 An complex anti-symmetric 2-form \ufb01eld in the (2, n \u22123, 0) representation, given\nby Q2 \u00afQ2On, of the form Tr(F\u00b5\u03bd[\u03c6J1, \u03c6J2]\u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6In\u22122) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.\n\u2022 A symmetric tensor \ufb01eld in the (0, n \u22122, 0) representation, given by Q2 \u00afQ2On, of\nthe form Tr(D{\u00b5\u03c6JD\u03bd}\u03c6K\u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6In\u22122) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.\nThe spectrum of primary \ufb01elds at dimension n+3 is similar to that of dimension n+1\n(the same \ufb01elds appear but in smaller SU(4)R representations), and at dimension n+4\nthere is a single primary \ufb01eld, which is a real scalar in the (0, n \u22124, 0) representation,\ngiven by Q4 \u00afQ4On, of the form Tr(F 4\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6In\u22124) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7. Note that \ufb01elds with more\nthan four F\u00b5\u03bd\u2019s or more than eight \u03bb\u2019s are always descendants or non-chiral primaries.\nFor n = 2, 3 the short multiplets are even shorter since some of the representations\nappearing above vanish. In particular, for n = 2 the highest-dimension primaries in the\nchiral primary multiplet have dimension n + 2 = 4. The n = 2 representation includes\nthe currents of the superconformal algebra. It includes a vector of dimension 3 in the\n15 representation which is the SU(4)R R-symmetry current, and a symmetric tensor\n\ufb01eld of dimension 4 which is the energy-momentum tensor (the other currents of the\nsuperconformal algebra are descendants of these). The n = 2 multiplet also includes\na complex scalar \ufb01eld which is an SU(4)R-singlet, whose real part is the Lagrangian\ndensity coupling to\n1\n4g2\nY M (of the form Tr(F 2\n\u00b5\u03bd) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) and whose imaginary part is the\nLagrangian density coupling to \u03b8 (of the form Tr(F \u2227F)). For later use we note that\nthe chiral primary multiplets which contain scalars of dimension \u2206\u22644 are the n = 2\nmultiplet (which has a scalar in the 20\u2032 of dimension 2, a complex scalar in the 10 of\ndimension 3, and a complex scalar in the 1 of dimension 4), the n = 3 multiplet (which\ncontains a scalar in the 50 of dimension 3 and a complex scalar in the 45 of dimension\n4), and the n = 4 multiplet which contains a scalar in the 105 of dimension 4.\nThe String Theory Spectrum and the Matching\nAs discussed in section 3.1.2, \ufb01elds on AdS5 are in a one-to-one correspondence with\noperators in the dual conformal \ufb01eld theory. Thus, the spectrum of operators described\nin section 3.2.1 should agree with the spectrum of \ufb01elds of type IIB string theory on\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5. Fields on AdS naturally lie in the same multiplets of the conformal group\nas primary operators; the second Casimir of these representations is C2 = \u2206(\u2206\u22124) for\na primary scalar \ufb01eld of dimension \u2206in the \ufb01eld theory, and C2 = m2R2 for a \ufb01eld of\nmass m on an AdS5 space with a radius of curvature R. Single-trace operators in the\n\ufb01eld theory may be identi\ufb01ed with single-particle states in AdS5, while multiple-trace\noperators correspond to multi-particle states.\n75\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is not known how to compute the full spectrum of type IIB string\ntheory on AdS5 \u00d7S5. In fact, the only known states are the states which arise from the\ndimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional type IIB supergravity multiplet. These\n\ufb01elds all have helicities between (\u22122) and 2, so it is clear that they all lie in small mul-\ntiplets of the superconformal algebra, and we will describe below how they match with\nthe small multiplets of the \ufb01eld theory described above. String theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 is\nexpected to have many additional states, with masses of the order of the string scale 1/ls\nor of the Planck scale 1/lp. Such states would correspond (using the mass/dimension\nrelation described above) to operators in the \ufb01eld theory with dimensions of order\n\u2206\u223c(gsN)1/4 or \u2206\u223cN1/4 for large N, gsN. Presumably none of these states are in\nsmall multiplets of the superconformal algebra (at least, this would be the prediction\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence).\nThe spectrum of type IIB supergravity compacti\ufb01ed on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 was computed in\n[126]. The computation involves expanding the ten dimensional \ufb01elds in appropriate\nspherical harmonics on S5, plugging them into the supergravity equations of motion,\nlinearized around the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background, and diagonalizing the equations to give\nequations of motion for free (massless or massive) \ufb01elds4. For example, the ten dimen-\nsional dilaton \ufb01eld \u03c4 may be expanded as \u03c4(x, y) =\nP\u221e\nk=0 \u03c4 k(x)Y k(y) where x is a coor-\ndinate on AdS5, y is a coordinate on S5, and the Y k are the scalar spherical harmonics\non S5. These spherical harmonics are in representations corresponding to symmetric\ntraceless products of 6\u2019s of SU(4)R; they may be written as Y k(y) \u223cyI1yI2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 yIk\nwhere the yI, for I = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 6 and with\nP6\nI=1(yI)2 = 1, are coordinates on S5. Thus,\nwe \ufb01nd a \ufb01eld \u03c4 k(x) on AdS5 in each such (0, k, 0) representation of SU(4)R, and the\nequations of motion determine the mass of this \ufb01eld to be m2\nk = k(k +4)/R2. A similar\nexpansion may be performed for all other \ufb01elds.\nIf we organize the results of [126] into representations of the superconformal algebra\n[85], we \ufb01nd representations of the form described in the previous section, which are\nbuilt on a lowest dimension \ufb01eld which is a scalar in the (0, n, 0) representation of\nSU(4)R for n = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u221e. The lowest dimension scalar \ufb01eld in each representation\nturns out to arise from a linear combination of spherical harmonic modes of the S5\ncomponents of the graviton ha\na (expanded around the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 vacuum) and the\n4-form \ufb01eld Dabcd, where a, b, c, d are indices on S5. The scalar \ufb01elds of dimension\nn + 1 correspond to 2-form \ufb01elds Bab with indices in the S5. The symmetric tensor\n\ufb01elds arise from the expansion of the AdS5-components of the graviton. The dilaton\n\ufb01elds described above are the complex scalar \ufb01elds arising with dimension n + 2 in the\nmultiplet (as described in the previous subsection).\nIn particular, the n = 2 representation is called the supergraviton representation, and\n4The \ufb01elds arising from di\ufb00erent spherical harmonics are related by a \u201cspectrum generating alge-\nbra\u201d, see [214].\n76\n\n\nit includes the \ufb01eld content of d = 5, N = 8 gauged supergravity. The \ufb01eld/operator\ncorrespondence matches this representation to the representation including the super-\nconformal currents in the \ufb01eld theory. It includes a massless graviton \ufb01eld, which (as\nexpected) corresponds to the energy-momentum tensor in the \ufb01eld theory, and massless\nSU(4)R gauge \ufb01elds which correspond to (or couple to) the global SU(4)R currents in\nthe \ufb01eld theory.\nIn the naive dimensional reduction of the type IIB supergravity \ufb01elds, the n = 1\ndoubleton representation, corresponding to a free U(1) vector multiplet in the dual\ntheory, also appears. However, the modes of this multiplet are all pure gauge modes in\nthe bulk of AdS5, and they may be set to zero there. This is one of the reasons why it\nseems more natural to view the corresponding gauge theory as an SU(N) gauge theory\nand not a U(N) theory. It may be possible (and perhaps even natural) to add the\ndoubleton representation to the theory (even though it does not include modes which\npropagate in the bulk of AdS5, but instead it is equivalent to a topological theory in\nthe bulk) to obtain a theory which is dual to the U(N) gauge theory, but this will not\na\ufb00ect most of our discussion in this review so we will ignore this possibility here.\nComparing the results described above with the results of section 3.2.1, we see that\nwe \ufb01nd the same spectrum of chiral primary operators for n = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, N. The super-\ngravity results cannot be trusted for masses above the order of the string scale (which\ncorresponds to n \u223c(gsN)1/4) or the Planck scale (which corresponds to n \u223cN1/4), so\nthe results agree within their range of validity. The \ufb01eld theory results suggest that the\nexact spectrum of chiral representations in type IIB string theory on AdS5\u00d7S5 actually\nmatches the naive supergravity spectrum up to a mass scale m2 \u223cN2/R2 \u223cN3/2M2\np\nwhich is much higher than the string scale and the Planck scale, and that there are no\nchiral \ufb01elds above this scale. It is not known how to check this prediction; tree-level\nstring theory is certainly not enough for this since when gs = 0 we must take N = \u221eto\nobtain a \ufb01nite value of gsN. Thus, with our current knowledge the matching of chiral\nprimaries of the N = 4 SYM theory with those of string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 tests\nthe duality only in the large N limit. In some generalizations of the AdS/CFT corre-\nspondence the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary even for \ufb01nite N, and then\nclassical string theory should lead to exactly the same spectrum of chiral operators as\nthe \ufb01eld theory. This happens in particular for the near-horizon limit of NS5-branes, in\nwhich case the exact spectrum was successfully compared in [215]. In other instances\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence (such as the ones discussed in [216, 217, 218]) there\nexist also additional chiral primary multiplets with n of order N, and these have been\nsuccessfully matched with wrapped branes on the string theory side.\nThe fact that there seem to be no non-chiral \ufb01elds on AdS5 with a mass below the\nstring scale suggests that for large N and large gsN, the dimension of all non-chiral\noperators in the \ufb01eld theory, such as Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6I), grows at least as (gsN)1/4 \u223c(g2\nY MN)1/4.\n77\n\n\nThe reason for this behavior on the \ufb01eld theory side is not clear; it is a prediction of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence.\n3.2.2\nMatching of Correlation Functions and Anomalies\nThe classical N = 4 theory has a scale invariance symmetry and an SU(4)R R-\nsymmetry, and (unlike many other theories) these symmetries are exact also in the\nfull quantum theory. However, when the theory is coupled to external gravitational or\nSU(4)R gauge \ufb01elds, these symmetries are broken by quantum e\ufb00ects. In \ufb01eld theory\nthis breaking comes from one-loop diagrams and does not receive any further correc-\ntions; thus it can be computed also in the strong coupling regime and compared with\nthe results from string theory on AdS space.\nWe will begin by discussing the anomaly associated with the SU(4)R global currents.\nThese currents are chiral since the fermions \u03bb\u03b1A are in the \u00af4 representation while the\nfermions of the opposite chirality \u00af\u03bbA\n\u02d9\u03b1 are in the 4 representation. Thus, if we gauge the\nSU(4)R global symmetry, we will \ufb01nd an Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the triangle\ndiagram of three SU(4)R currents, which is proportional to the number of charged\nfermions. In the SU(N) gauge theory this number is N2 \u22121. The anomaly can be\nexpressed either in terms of the 3-point function of the SU(4)R global currents,\nD\nJa\n\u00b5(x)Jb\n\u03bd(y)Jc\n\u03c1(z)\nE\n\u2212= \u2212N2 \u22121\n32\u03c06 idabcTr [\u03b35\u03b3\u00b5(\u0338 x\u2212\u0338 y)\u03b3\u03bd(\u0338 y\u2212\u0338 z)\u03b3\u03c1(\u0338 z\u2212\u0338 x)]\n(x \u2212y)4(y \u2212z)4(z \u2212x)4\n,\n(3.27)\nwhere dabc = 2Tr(T a{T b, T c}) and we take only the negative parity component of the\ncorrelator, or in terms of the non-conservation of the SU(4)R current when the theory\nis coupled to external SU(4)R gauge \ufb01elds F a\n\u00b5\u03bd,\n(D\u00b5J\u00b5)a = N2 \u22121\n384\u03c02 idabc\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F b\n\u00b5\u03bdF c\n\u03c1\u03c3.\n(3.28)\nHow can we see this e\ufb00ect in string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 ?\nOne way to see it\nis, of course, to use the general prescription of section 3.3 to compute the 3-point\nfunction (3.27), and indeed one \ufb01nds [219, 220] the correct answer to leading order\nin the large N limit (namely, one recovers the term proportional to N2). It is more\nilluminating, however, to consider directly the meaning of the anomaly (3.28) from the\npoint of view of the AdS theory [20]. In the AdS theory we have gauge \ufb01elds Aa\n\u00b5 which\ncouple, as explained above, to the SU(4)R global currents Ja\n\u00b5 of the gauge theory, but\nthe anomaly means that when we turn on non-zero \ufb01eld strengths for these \ufb01elds the\ntheory should no longer be gauge invariant. This e\ufb00ect is precisely reproduced by a\nChern-Simons term which exists in the low-energy supergravity theory arising from the\n78\n\n\ncompacti\ufb01cation of type IIB supergravity on AdS5 \u00d7 S5, which is of the form\niN2\n96\u03c02\nZ\nAdS5\nd5x(dabc\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\u03c3Aa\n\u00b5\u2202\u03bdAb\n\u03bb\u2202\u03c1Ac\n\u03c3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7).\n(3.29)\nThis term is gauge invariant up to total derivatives, which means that if we take a\ngauge transformation Aa\n\u00b5 \u2192Aa\n\u00b5 +(D\u00b5\u039b)a for which \u039b does not vanish on the boundary\nof AdS5, the action will change by a boundary term of the form\n\u2212iN2\n384\u03c02\nZ\n\u2202AdS5\nd4x\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3dabc\u039baF b\n\u00b5\u03bdF c\n\u03c1\u03c3.\n(3.30)\nFrom this we can read o\ufb00the anomaly in (D\u00b5J\u00b5) since, when we have a coupling of\nthe form\nR d4xA\u00b5\naJa\n\u00b5, the change in the action under a gauge transformation is given by\nR d4x(D\u00b5\u039b)aJa\n\u00b5 = \u2212\nR d4x\u039ba(D\u00b5Ja\n\u00b5), and we \ufb01nd exact agreement with (3.28) for large\nN.\nThe other anomaly in the N = 4 SYM theory is the conformal (or Weyl) anomaly\n(see [221, 222] and references therein), indicating the breakdown of conformal invariance\nwhen the theory is coupled to a curved external metric (there is a similar breakdown of\nconformal invariance when the theory is coupled to external SU(4)R gauge \ufb01elds, which\nwe will not discuss here). The conformal anomaly is related to the 2-point and 3-point\nfunctions of the energy-momentum tensor [223, 224, 74, 225]. In four dimensions, the\ngeneral form of the conformal anomaly is\n\u27e8g\u00b5\u03bdT\u00b5\u03bd\u27e9= \u2212aE4 \u2212cI4,\n(3.31)\nwhere\nE4 =\n1\n16\u03c02(R2\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u22124R2\n\u00b5\u03bd + R2),\nI4 = \u2212\n1\n16\u03c02(R2\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u22122R2\n\u00b5\u03bd + 1\n3R2),\n(3.32)\nwhere R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is the curvature tensor, R\u00b5\u03bd \u2261R\u03c1\n\u00b5\u03c1\u03bd is the Riemann tensor, and R \u2261R\u00b5\n\u00b5 is\nthe scalar curvature. A free \ufb01eld computation in the SU(N) N = 4 SYM theory leads\nto a = c = (N2 \u22121)/4. In supersymmetric theories the supersymmetry algebra relates\ng\u00b5\u03bdT\u00b5\u03bd to derivatives of the R-symmetry current, so it is protected from any quantum\ncorrections. Thus, the same result should be obtained in type IIB string theory on\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5, and to leading order in the large N limit it should be obtained from type\nIIB supergravity on AdS5\u00d7S5. This was indeed found to be true in [226, 227, 228, 229]5,\nwhere the conformal anomaly was shown to arise from subtleties in the regularization\nof the (divergent) supergravity action on AdS space. The result of [226, 227, 228, 229]\nimplies that a computation using gravity on AdS5 always gives rise to theories with\n5A generalization with more varying \ufb01elds may be found in [230].\n79\n\n\na = c, so generalizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence which have (for large N) a\nsupergravity approximation are limited to conformal theories which have a = c in the\nlarge N limit. Of course, if we do not require the string theory to have a supergravity\napproximation then there is no such restriction.\nFor both of the anomalies we described the \ufb01eld theory and string theory computa-\ntions agree for the leading terms, which are of order N2. Thus, they are successful tests\nof the duality in the large N limit. For other instances of the AdS/CFT correspondence\nthere are corrections to anomalies at order 1/N \u223cgs(\u03b1\u2032/R2)2; such corrections were\ndiscussed in [231] and successfully compared in [232, 233, 234]6. It would be interesting\nto compare other corrections to the large N result.\nComputations of other correlation functions [235, 236, 237], such as 3-point func-\ntions of chiral primary operators and correlation functions which have only instanton\ncontributions (we will discuss these in section 4.2), have suggested that they are also\nthe same at small \u03bb and at large \u03bb, even though they are not related to anomalies in\nany known way. Perhaps there is some non-renormalization theorem also for these cor-\nrelation functions, in which case their agreement would also be a test of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. As discussed in [238, 239] (see also [146]) the non-renormalization\ntheorem for 3-point functions of chiral primary operators would follow from a conjec-\ntured U(1)Y symmetry of the 3-point functions of N = 4 SCFTs involving at least two\noperators which are descendants of chiral primaries7. This symmetry is a property of\ntype IIB supergravity on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 but not of the full type IIB string theory.\n3.3\nCorrelation Functions\nA useful statement of the AdS/CFT correspondence is that the partition function of\nstring theory on AdS5 \u00d7S5 should coincide with the partition function of N = 4 super-\nYang-Mills theory \u201con the boundary\u201d of AdS5 [19, 20]. The basic idea was explained\nin section 3.1.2, but before summarizing the actual calculations of Green\u2019s functions, it\nseems worthwhile to motivate the methodology from a somewhat di\ufb00erent perspective.\nThroughout this section, we approximate the string theory partition function by\ne\u2212ISUGRA, where ISUGRA is the supergravity action evaluated on AdS5 \u00d7S5 (or on small\ndeformations of this space). This approximation amounts to ignoring all the stringy \u03b1\u2032\ncorrections that cure the divergences of supergravity, and also all the loop corrections,\nwhich are controlled essentially by the gravitational coupling \u03ba \u223cgst\u03b1\u20322. On the gauge\n6Computing such corrections tests the conjecture that the correspondence holds order by order in\n1/N; however, this is weaker than the statement that the correspondence holds for \ufb01nite N, since the\n1/N expansion is not expected to converge.\n7A proof of this, using the analytic harmonic superspace formalism which is conjectured to be valid\nin the N = 4 theory, was recently given in [240].\n80\n\n\ntheory side, as explained in section 3.1.2, this approximation amounts to taking both\nN and g2\nY MN large, and the basic relation becomes\ne\u2212ISUGRA \u2243Zstring = Zgauge = e\u2212W ,\n(3.33)\nwhere W is the generating functional for connected Green\u2019s functions in the gauge\ntheory. At \ufb01nite temperature, W = \u03b2F where \u03b2 is the inverse temperature and F is the\nfree energy of the gauge theory. When we apply this relation to a Schwarzschild black\nhole in AdS5, which is thought to be re\ufb02ected in the gauge theory by a thermal state\nat the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we arrive at the relation ISUGRA \u2243\u03b2F.\nCalculating the free energy of a black hole from the Euclidean supergravity action has\na long tradition in the supergravity literature [241], so the main claim that is being\nmade here is that the dual gauge theory provides a description of the state of the black\nhole which is physically equivalent to the one in string theory. We will discuss the\n\ufb01nite temperature case further in section 3.6, and devote the rest of this section to the\npartition function of the \ufb01eld theory on R4.\nThe main technical idea behind the bulk-boundary correspondence is that the bound-\nary values of string theory \ufb01elds (in particular, supergravity \ufb01elds) act as sources for\ngauge-invariant operators in the \ufb01eld theory. From a D-brane perspective, we think of\nclosed string states in the bulk as sourcing gauge singlet operators on the brane which\noriginate as composite operators built from open strings. We will write the bulk \ufb01elds\ngenerically as \u03c6(\u20d7x, z) (in the coordinate system (3.17)), with value \u03c60(\u20d7x) for z = \u01eb.\nThe true boundary of anti-de Sitter space is z = 0, and \u01eb \u0338= 0 serves as a cuto\ufb00which\nwill eventually be removed. In the supergravity approximation, we think of choosing\nthe values \u03c60 arbitrarily and then extremizing the action ISUGRA[\u03c6] in the region z > \u01eb\nsubject to these boundary conditions. In short, we solve the equations of motion in\nthe bulk subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary, and evaluate the\naction on the solution. If there is more than one solution, then we have more than\none saddle point contributing to the string theory partition function, and we must\ndetermine which is most important. In this section, multiple saddle points will not be\na problem. So, we can write\nWgauge[\u03c60] = \u2212log\nD\ne\nR\nd4x \u03c60(x)O(x)E\nCF T \u2243extremum\n\u03c6|z=\u01eb=\u03c60\nISUGRA[\u03c6] .\n(3.34)\nThat is, the generator of connected Green\u2019s functions in the gauge theory, in the large\nN, g2\nY MN limit, is the on-shell supergravity action.\nNote that in (3.34) we have not attempted to be prescient about inserting factors\nof \u01eb. Instead our strategy will be to use (3.34) without modi\ufb01cation to compute two-\npoint functions of O, and then perform a wave-function renormalization on either O\nor \u03c6 so that the \ufb01nal answer is independent of the cuto\ufb00. This approach should be\n81\n\n\nworkable even in a space (with boundary) which is not asymptotically anti-de Sitter,\ncorresponding to a \ufb01eld theory which does not have a conformal \ufb01xed point in the\nultraviolet.\nA remark is in order regarding the relation of (3.34) to the old approach of extracting\nGreen\u2019s functions from an absorption cross-section [12]. In absorption calculations one\nis keeping the whole D3-brane geometry, not just the near-horizon AdS5 \u00d7 S5 throat.\nThe usual treatment is to split the space into a near region (the throat) and a far\nregion. The incoming wave from asymptotically \ufb02at in\ufb01nity can be regarded as \ufb01xing\nthe value of a supergravity \ufb01eld at the outer boundary of the near region. As usual,\nthe supergravity description is valid at large N and large \u2019t Hooft coupling. At small\n\u2019t Hooft coupling, there is a di\ufb00erent description of the process: a cluster of D3-branes\nsits at some location in \ufb02at ten-dimensional space, and the incoming wave impinges\nupon it. In the low-energy limit, the value of the supergravity \ufb01eld which the D3-branes\nfeel is the same as the value in the curved space description at the boundary of the\nnear horizon region. Equation (3.34) is just a mathematical expression of the fact that\nthe throat geometry should respond identically to the perturbed supergravity \ufb01elds as\nthe low-energy theory on the D3-branes.\nFollowing [19, 20], a number of papers\u2014notably [242, 243, 219, 244, 220, 245, 246,\n235, 247, 236, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]\u2014have undertaken the program of ex-\ntracting explicit n-point correlation functions of gauge singlet operators by developing\nboth sides of (3.34) in a power series in \u03c60. Because the right hand side is the extrem-\nization of a classical action, the power series has a graphical representation in terms\nof tree-level Feynman graphs for \ufb01elds in the supergravity. There is one di\ufb00erence: in\nordinary Feynman graphs one assigns the wavefunctions of asymptotic states to the\nexternal legs of the graph, but in the present case the external leg factors re\ufb02ect the\nboundary values \u03c60. They are special limits of the usual gravity propagators in the\nbulk, and are called bulk-to-boundary propagators. We will encounter their explicit\nform in the next two sections.\n3.3.1\nTwo-point Functions\nFor two-point functions, only the part of the action which is quadratic in the relevant\n\ufb01eld perturbation is needed. For massive scalar \ufb01elds in AdS5, this has the generic\nform\nS = \u03b7\nZ\nd5x \u221ag\nh\n1\n2(\u2202\u03c6)2 + 1\n2m2\u03c62i\n,\n(3.35)\nwhere \u03b7 is some normalization which in principle follows from the ten-dimensional\norigin of the action. The bulk-to-boundary propagator is a particular solution of the\nequation of motion, (\n\u2212m2)\u03c6 = 0, which has special asymptotic properties. We will\nstart by considering the momentum space propagator, which is useful for computing\n82\n\n\nthe two-point function and also in situations where the bulk geometry loses conformal\ninvariance; then, we will discuss the position space propagator, which has proven more\nconvenient for the study of higher point correlators in the conformal case. We will\nalways work in Euclidean space8. A coordinate system in the bulk of AdS5 such that\nds2 = R2\nz2\n\u0010\nd\u20d7x2 + dz2\u0011\n(3.36)\nprovides manifest Euclidean symmetry on the directions parametrized by \u20d7x.

The leading analytic terms\ngive rise to contact terms in position space, and the higher order terms are unim-\nportant in the limit where we remove the cuto\ufb00. Only the leading nonanalytic\nterm is essential.\nWe have given the expression for generic real values of \u2206.\nExpanding around integer \u2206\u22652 one obtains \ufb01nite expressions involving log \u01ebp.\n\u2022 The Fourier transforms used to obtain the last line are singular, but they can be\nde\ufb01ned for generic complex \u2206by analytic continuation and for positive integer\n\u2206by expanding around a pole and dropping divergent terms, in the spirit of\ndi\ufb00erential regularization [255]. The result is a pure power law dependence on\nthe separation |\u20d7x \u2212\u20d7y|, as required by conformal invariance.\n\u2022 We have assumed a coupling\nR d4x \u03c6(\u20d7x, z = \u01eb)O(\u20d7x) to compute the Green\u2019s func-\ntions. The explicit powers of the cuto\ufb00in the \ufb01nal position space answer can\nbe eliminated by absorbing a factor of \u01eb\u2206\u22124 into the de\ufb01nition of O. From here\non we will take that convention, which amounts to inserting a factor of \u01eb4\u2212\u2206on\nthe right hand side of (3.39). In fact, precise matchings between the normal-\nizations in \ufb01eld theory and in string theory for all the chiral primary operators\nhave not been worked out. In part this is due to the di\ufb03culty of determining\nthe coupling of bulk \ufb01elds to \ufb01eld theory operators (or in stringy terms, the cou-\npling of closed string states to composite open string operators on the brane).\nSee [11] for an early approach to this problem. For the dilaton, the graviton,\nand their superpartners (including gauge \ufb01elds in AdS5), the couplings can be\nworked out explicitly. In some of these cases all normalizations have been worked\nout unambiguously and checked against \ufb01eld theory predictions (see for example\n[19, 219, 236]).\n\u2022 The mass-dimension relation (3.38) holds even for string states that are not in-\ncluded in the Kaluza-Klein supergravity reduction: the mass and the dimension\nare just di\ufb00erent expressions of the second Casimir of SO(4, 2). For instance,\nexcited string states, with m \u223c1/\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032, are expected to correspond to operators\nwith dimension \u2206\u223c(g2\nY MN)1/4. The remarkable fact is that all the string the-\nory modes with m \u223c1/R (which is to say, all closed string states which arise\nfrom massless ten dimensional \ufb01elds) fall in short multiplets of the supergroup\nSU(2, 2|4). All other states have a much larger mass. The operators in short\nmultiplets have algebraically protected dimensions. The obvious conclusion is\nthat all operators whose dimensions are not algebraically protected have large\ndimension in the strong \u2019t Hooft coupling, large N limit to which supergravity\napplies. This is no longer true for theories of reduced supersymmetry: the su-\npergroup gets smaller, but the Kaluza-Klein states are roughly as numerous as\n84\n\n\nbefore, and some of them escape the short multiplets and live in long multiplets\nof the smaller supergroups. They still have a mass on the order of 1/R, and\ntypically correspond to dimensions which are \ufb01nite (in the large g2\nY MN limit)\nbut irrational.\nCorrelation functions of non-scalar operators have been widely studied following\n[20]; the literature includes [256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]. For\nN = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory, all correlation functions of \ufb01elds in chiral multiplets\nshould follow by application of supersymmetries once those of the chiral primary \ufb01elds\nare known, so in this case it should be enough to study the scalars. It is worthwhile\nto note however that the mass-dimension formula changes for particles with spin. In\nfact the de\ufb01nition of mass has some convention-dependence. Conventions seem fairly\nuniform in the literature, and a table of mass-dimension relations in AdSd+1 with unit\nradius was made in [145] from the various sources cited above (see also [211]):\n\u2022 scalars:\n\u2206\u00b1 = 1\n2(d \u00b1\n\u221a\nd2 + 4m2),\n\u2022 spinors:\n\u2206= 1\n2(d + 2|m|),\n\u2022 vectors:\n\u2206\u00b1 = 1\n2(d \u00b1\nq\n(d \u22122)2 + 4m2),\n\u2022 p-forms:\n\u2206= 1\n2(d \u00b1\nq\n(d \u22122p)2 + 4m2),\n\u2022 \ufb01rst-order (d/2)-forms (d even):\n\u2206= 1\n2(d + 2|m|),\n\u2022 spin-3/2:\n\u2206= 1\n2(d + 2|m|),\n\u2022 massless spin-2:\n\u2206= d.\nIn the case of \ufb01elds with second order lagrangians, we have not attempted to pick\nwhich of \u2206\u00b1 is the physical dimension. Usually the choice \u2206= \u2206+ is clear from the\nunitarity bound, but in some cases (notably m2 = 15/4 in AdS5) there is a genuine\nambiguity. In practice this ambiguity is usually resolved by appealing to some special\nalgebraic property of the relevant \ufb01elds, such as transformation under supersymmetry\nor a global bosonic symmetry. See section 2.2.2 for further discussion. The scalar case\nabove is precisely equation (2.36) in that section.\nFor brevity we will omit a further discussion of higher spins, and instead refer the\nreader to the (extensive) literature.\n3.3.2\nThree-point Functions\nWorking with bulk-to-boundary propagators in the momentum representation is conve-\nnient for two-point functions, but for higher point functions position space is preferred\n85\n\n\nbecause the full conformal invariance is more obvious. (However, for non-conformal ex-\namples of the bulk-boundary correspondence, the momentum representation seems uni-\nformly more convenient). The boundary behavior of position space bulk-to-boundary\npropagators is speci\ufb01ed in a slightly more subtle way: following [219] we require\nK\u2206(\u20d7x, z; \u20d7y) \u2192z4\u2212\u2206\u03b44(\u20d7x \u2212\u20d7y)\nas\nz \u21920 .\n(3.41)\nHere \u20d7y is the point on the boundary where we insert the operator, and (\u20d7x, z) is a point\nin the bulk. The unique regular K\u2206solving the equation of motion and satisfying\n(3.41) is\nK\u2206(\u20d7x, z; \u20d7y) =\n\u0393(\u2206)\n\u03c02\u0393(\u2206\u22122)\n \nz\nz2 + (\u20d7x \u2212\u20d7y)2\n!\u2206\n.\n(3.42)\nAt a \ufb01xed cuto\ufb00, z = \u01eb, the bulk-to-boundary propagator K\u2206(\u20d7x, \u01eb; \u20d7y) is a continuous\nfunction which approximates \u01eb4\u2212\u2206\u03b44(\u20d7x \u2212\u20d7y) better and better as \u01eb \u21920.\nThus at\nany \ufb01nite \u01eb, the Fourier transform of (3.42) only approximately coincides with (3.39)\n(modi\ufb01ed by the factor of \u01eb4\u2212\u2206as explained after (3.40)). This apparently innocuous\nsubtlety turned out to be important for two-point functions, as discovered in [219].\nA correct prescription is to specify boundary conditions at \ufb01nite z = \u01eb, cut o\ufb00all\nbulk integrals at that boundary, and only afterwards take \u01eb \u21920. That is what we\nhave done in (3.40). Calculating two-point functions directly using the position-space\npropagators (3.41), but cutting the bulk integrals o\ufb00again at \u01eb, and \ufb01nally taking the\nsame \u01eb \u21920 answer, one arrives at a di\ufb00erent answer. This is not surprising since the\nz = \u01eb boundary conditions were not used consistently. The authors of [219] checked\nthat using the cuto\ufb00consistently (i.e. with the momentum space propagators) gave\ntwo-point functions \u27e8O(\u20d7x1)O(\u20d7x2)\u27e9a normalization such that Ward identities involving\nthe three-point function \u27e8O(\u20d7x1)O(\u20d7x2)J\u00b5(\u20d7x3)\u27e9, where J\u00b5 is a conserved current, were\nobeyed. Two-point functions are uniquely di\ufb03cult because of the poor convergence\nproperties of the integrals over z. The integrals involved in three-point functions are\nsu\ufb03ciently benign that one can ignore the issue of how to impose the cuto\ufb00.\nIf one has a Euclidean bulk action for three scalar \ufb01elds \u03c61, \u03c62, and \u03c63, of the form\nS =\nZ\nd5x \u221ag\n\"X\ni\n1\n2(\u2202\u03c6i)2 + 1\n2m2\ni \u03c62\ni + \u03bb\u03c61\u03c62\u03c63\n#\n,\n(3.43)\nand if the \u03c6i couple to operators in the \ufb01eld theory by interaction terms\nR d4x \u03c6iOi,\nthen the calculation of \u27e8O1O2O3\u27e9reduces, via (3.34), to the evaluation of the graph\nshown in \ufb01gure 3.3.

This leads only to a\nmodi\ufb01cation of the constant a1.\nThe main technical di\ufb03culty with three-point functions is that one must \ufb01gure out\nthe cubic couplings of supergravity \ufb01elds. Because of the di\ufb03culties in writing down\na covariant action for type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions (see however [267, 268,\n269]), it is most straightforward to read o\ufb00these \u201ccubic couplings\u201d from quadratic\nterms in the equations of motion. In \ufb02at ten-dimensional space these terms can be read\no\ufb00directly from the original type IIB supergravity papers [125, 270]. For AdS5 \u00d7 S5,\none must instead expand in \ufb02uctuations around the background metric and \ufb01ve-form\n\ufb01eld strength.\nThe old literature [126] only dealt with the linearized equations of\nmotion; for 3-point functions it is necessary to go to one higher order of perturbation\ntheory.\nThis was done for a restricted set of \ufb01elds in [235].\nThe \ufb01elds considered\nwere those dual to operators of the form Tr\u03c6(J1\u03c6J2 . . . \u03c6J\u2113) in \ufb01eld theory, where the\nparentheses indicate a symmetrized traceless product. These operators are the chiral\nprimaries of the gauge theory: all other single trace operators of protected dimension\ndescend from these by commuting with supersymmetry generators. Only the metric\nand the \ufb01ve-form are involved in the dual supergravity \ufb01elds, and we are interested\nonly in modes which are scalars in AdS5. The result of [235] is that the equations of\n87\n\n\nmotion for the scalar modes \u02dcsI dual to\nOI = CI\nJ1...J\u2113Tr\u03c6(J1 . . . \u03c6J\u2113)\n(3.46)\nfollow from an action of the form\nS = 4N2\n(2\u03c0)5\nZ\nd5x \u221ag\n( X\nI\nAI(wI)2\n2\nh\n\u2212(\u2207\u02dcsI)2 \u2212l(l \u22124)\u02dcs2\nI\ni\n+\nX\nI1,I2,I3\nGI1I2I3wI1wI2wI3\n3\n\u02dcsI1\u02dcsI2\u02dcsI3\n)\n.\n(3.47)\nDerivative couplings of the form \u02dcs\u2202\u02dcs\u2202\u02dcs are expected a priori to enter into (3.47),\nbut an appropriate \ufb01eld rede\ufb01nition eliminates them.\nThe notation in (3.46) and\n(3.47) requires some explanation. I is an index which runs over the weight vectors\nof all possible representations constructed as symmetric traceless products of the 6 of\nSU(4)R. These are the representations whose Young diagrams are ,\n,\n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7. CI\nJ1...J\u2113\nis a basis transformation matrix, chosen so that CI\nJ1...J\u2113CJ\nJ1...J\u2113= \u03b4IJ. As commented in\nthe previous section, there is generally a normalization ambiguity on how supergravity\n\ufb01elds couple to operators in the gauge theory.\nWe have taken the coupling to be\nR d4x \u02dcsIOI, and the normalization ambiguity is represented by the \u201cleg factors\u201d wI.\nIt is the combination sI = wI\u02dcsI rather than \u02dcsI itself which has a de\ufb01nite relation\nto supergravity \ufb01elds.\nWe refer the reader to [235] for explicit expressions for AI\nand the symmetric tensor GI1I2I3. To get rid of factors of wI, we introduce operators\nOI = \u02dcwIOI. One can choose \u02dcwI so that a two-point function computation along the\nlines of section 3.3.1 leads to\n\u27e8OI1(\u20d7x)OI2(0)\u27e9= \u03b4I1I2\nx2\u22061 .\n(3.48)\nWith this choice, the three-point function, as calculated using (3.44), is\n\u27e8OI1( \u20d7x1)OI2( \u20d7x2)OI3( \u20d7x3)\u27e9= 1\nN\n\u221a\u22061\u22062\u22063\u27e8CI1CI2CI3\u27e9\n|\u20d7x1 \u2212\u20d7x2|\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u22063|\u20d7x1 \u2212\u20d7x3|\u22061+\u22063\u2212\u22062|\u20d7x2 \u2212\u20d7x3|\u22062+\u22063\u2212\u22061 ,\n(3.49)\nwhere we have de\ufb01ned\n\u27e8CI1CI2CI3\u27e9= CI1\nJ1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7JiK1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7KjCI2\nJ1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7JiL1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7LkCI3\nK1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7KjL1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Lk .\n(3.50)\nRemarkably, (3.49) is the same result one obtains from free \ufb01eld theory by Wick con-\ntracting all the \u03c6J \ufb01elds in the three operators. This suggests that there is a non-\nrenormalization theorem for this correlation function, but such a theorem has not yet\nbeen proven (see however comments at the end of section 3.2.2). It is worth emphasiz-\ning that the normalization ambiguity in the bulk-boundary coupling is circumvented\nessentially by considering invariant ratios of three-point functions and two-point func-\ntions, into which the \u201cleg factors\u201d wI do not enter. This is the same strategy as was\npursued in comparing matrix models of quantum gravity to Liouville theory.\n88\n\n\n3.3.3\nFour-point Functions\nThe calculation of four-point functions is di\ufb03cult because there are several graphs\nwhich contribute, and some of them inevitably involve bulk-to-bulk propagators of\n\ufb01elds with spin. The computation of four-point functions of the operators O\u03c6 and OC\ndual to the dilaton and the axion was completed in [271].

This is the natural result from the \ufb01eld theory\npoint of view because there are O(N2) degrees of freedom contributing to each factor,\nand the commutation relations between them are non-trivial only a fraction 1/N2 of\nthe time. From the supergravity point of view, a composite operator like : O\u03c6O\u03c6 :\ncorresponds to a two-particle bulk state, and the O(1/N2) = O(\u03ba2/R8) correction to\nthe mass is interpreted as the correction to the mass of the two-particle state from\ngravitational binding energy. Roughly one is thinking of graviton exchange between\nthe legs of \ufb01gure 3.4 that are nearly coincident.\nIf (3.54) is expanded in inverse powers of N, then the O(1/N2) correction to \u2206n\nand \u2206m shows up to leading order as a term proportional to a logarithm of some\ncombination of the separations \u20d7xij.

This is the correct form to be interpreted in terms of the propagation\nof a two-particle state dual to an operator whose dimension is slightly di\ufb00erent from 8.\n3.4\nIsomorphism of Hilbert Spaces\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence is a statement about the equivalence of two quantum\ntheories: string theory (or M theory) on AdSp+2 \u00d7 (compact space) and CFTp+1. The\ntwo quantum theories are equivalent if there is an isomorphism between their Hilbert\nspaces, and moreover if the operator algebras on the Hilbert spaces are equivalent. In\nthis section, we discuss the isomorphism of the Hilbert spaces, following [277, 185, 278,\n279]. Related issues have been discussed in [280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288].\nStates in the Hilbert space of CFTp+1 fall into representations of the global conformal\ngroup SO(2, p + 1) on Rp,1.\nAt the same time, the isometry group of AdS is also\nSO(2, p + 1), and we can use it to classify states in the string theory.\nThus, it is\n90\n\n\nuseful to compare states in the two theories by organizing them into representations\nof SO(2, p + 1). The conformal group SO(2, p + 1) has 1\n2(p + 2)(p + 3) generators,\nJab = \u2212Jba (a, b = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, p + 2), obeying the commutation relation\n[Jab, Jcd] = \u2212i(gacJbd \u00b1 permutations)\n(3.55)\nwith the metric gab = diag(\u22121, +1, +1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, +1, \u22121). In CFTp+1, they are identi\ufb01ed\nwith the Poincar\u00b4e generators P\u00b5 and M\u00b5\u03bd, the dilatation D and the special conformal\ngenerators K\u00b5 (\u00b5, \u03bd = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, p), by the formulas\nJp+2,p+1 = D, J\u00b5,p+2 = 1\n2(K\u00b5 + P\u00b5), J\u00b5,p+1 = 1\n2(K\u00b5 \u2212P\u00b5), J\u00b5\u03bd = M\u00b5\u03bd.\n(3.56)\nSince the \ufb01eld theory on Rp,1 has no scale, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian P0 is\ncontinuous and there is no normalizable ground state with respect to P0. This is also\nthe case for the string theory on AdSp+2. The Killing vector \u2202t corresponding to P0\nhas the norm\n||\u2202t|| = Ru,\n(3.57)\nand it vanishes as u \u21920. Consequently, a stationary wave solution of the linearized\nsupergravity on AdS has a continuous frequency spectrum with respect to the timelike\ncoordinate t. It is not easy to compare the spectrum of P0 of the two theories.\nIt is more useful to compare the two Hilbert spaces using the maximum compact\nsubgroup SO(2) \u00d7 SO(p + 1) of the conformal group [277]. The Minkowski space Rp,1\nis conformally embedded in the Einstein Universe R \u00d7 Sp, and SO(2) \u00d7 SO(p + 1) is\nits isometry group. In particular, the generator J0,p+2 = 1\n2(P0 + K0) of SO(2) is the\nHamiltonian for the CFT on R \u00d7 Sp. Now we have a scale in the problem, which is\nthe radius of Sp, and the Hamiltonian 1\n2(P0 + K0) has a mass gap. In string theory on\nAdSp+2, the generator 1\n2(P0 + K0) corresponds to the global time translation along the\ncoordinate \u03c4. This is a globally well-de\ufb01ned coordinate on AdS and the Killing vector\n\u2202\u03c4 is everywhere non-vanishing:\n||\u2202\u03c4|| =\nR\ncos \u03b8.\n(3.58)\nTherefore, a stationary wave solution with respect to \u03c4 is normalizable and has a\ndiscrete frequency spectrum.\nIn fact, as we saw in section 2.2.4, the frequency is\nquantized in such a way that bosonic \ufb01elds in the supergravity multiplet are periodic\nand their superpartners are anti-periodic (i.e. obeying the supersymmetry preserving\nRamond boundary condition) in the \u03c4-direction with the period 2\u03c0R.\n3.4.1\nHilbert Space of String Theory\nWith the techniques that are currently available, we can make reliable statements about\nthe Hilbert space structure of string theory on AdS only when the curvature radius R\n91\n\n\nof AdS is much larger than the string length ls. In this section we will study some of\nthe properties of the Hilbert space that we can see in the AdS description. We will\nconcentrate on the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 case, but it is easy to generalize this to other cases.\nWe \ufb01rst consider the case that corresponds to the \u2019t Hooft limit gs \u21920, gsN \ufb01xed\nand large, so that we can trust the gravity approximation.\n(1) E \u226ams; Gas of Free Gravitons\nThe Hilbert space for low energies is well approximated by the Fock space of gravitons\nand their superpartners on AdS5 \u00d7S5. Since \u03c4 is a globally de\ufb01ned timelike coordinate\non AdS, we can consider stationary wave solutions in the linearized supergravity, which\nare the normalizable states discussed in section 2.2.2. The frequency \u03c9 of a stationary\nmode is quantized in the unit set by the curvature radius R (2.41), so one may e\ufb00ectively\nview the supergravity particles in AdS as con\ufb01ned in a box of size R.\nThe operator H =\n1\n2R(P0 +K0) corresponds10 to the Killing vector \u2202\u03c4 on AdS. Thus,\na single particle state of frequency \u03c9 gives an eigenstate of H. Since the supergraviton\nis a BPS particle, its energy eigenvalue \u03c9 is exact, free from corrections either by\n\ufb01rst quantized string e\ufb00ects (\u223cls/R) or by quantum gravity e\ufb00ects (\u223clP/R). The\nenergy of multiparticle states may receive corrections, but they become important only\nwhen the energy E becomes comparable to the gravitational potential E2/(m8\nPR7), i.e.\nE \u223cm8\nPR7. For the energies we are considering this e\ufb00ect is negligible.\nTherefore, the Hilbert space for E \u226ams is identi\ufb01ed with the Fock space of free\nsupergravity particles. For E \u226bR\u22121, the entropy S(E) (= log N(E) where N(E) is\nthe density of states) behaves as\nS(E) \u223c(ER)\n9\n10,\n(3.59)\nsince we e\ufb00ectively have a gas in ten dimensions (we will ignore multiplicative numerical\nfactors in the entropy in this section).\n(2) ms < E \u226ams/g2\ns; Gas of Free Strings\nWhen the energy E becomes comparable to the string scale ms, we have to take\ninto account excitations on the string worldsheet. Although we do not know the exact\n\ufb01rst quantized spectrum of string theory on AdS, we can estimate the e\ufb00ects of the\nworldsheet excitations when ls \u226aR. The mass m of a \ufb01rst quantized string state is a\nfunction of ls and R. When ls \u226aR, the worldsheet dynamics is perturbative and we\ncan expand m in powers of ls/R, with the leading term given by the string spectrum\non \ufb02at space (R = \u221e). Therefore, for a string state corresponding to the n-th excited\n10The factor\n1\n2R in the relation between H and (P0 + K0) is \ufb01xed by the commutation relations\n(3.55).\n92\n\n\nlevel of the string on \ufb02at space, the (mass)2 is given by\nm2 = l\u22122\ns\n\u0010\nn + O(l2\ns/R2)\n\u0011\n.\n(3.60)\nUnlike the single particle supergravity states discussed in the previous paragraph, string\nexcitations need not carry integral eigenvalues of H (in units of R\u22121). As they are not\nBPS particles, they are generically unstable in string perturbation theory.\nThe free string spectrum in 10 dimensions gives the Hagedorn density of states\nS(E) \u2243Els.\n(3.61)\nThus, the entropy of supergravity particles (3.59) becomes comparable to that of ex-\ncited strings (3.61) when\n(ER)\n9\n10 \u223cEls,\n(3.62)\nnamely\nE \u223cm10\ns R9.\n(3.63)\nFor m10\ns R9 < E, excited strings dominate the Hilbert space. The free string formula\n(3.61) is reliable until the energy hits another transition point E \u223cms/g2\ns. We are\nassuming that R9 < l9\ns/g2\ns, which is true in the \u2019t Hooft region.\n(3) ms/g2\ns \u226aE \u226am8\nPR7; Small Black Hole\nAs we increase the energy, the gas of free strings starts collapsing to make a black\nhole. The black hole can be described by the classical supergravity when the horizon\nradius r+ becomes larger than the string length ls. Furthermore, if the horizon size\nr+ is smaller than R, the geometry near the black hole can be approximated by the\n10-dimensional Schwarzschild solution. The energy E and the entropy S of such a\nblack hole is given by\nE\n\u223c\nm8\nPr7\n+\nS\n\u223c\n(mPr+)8.\n(3.64)\nTherefore, the entropy is estimated to be\nS(E) \u223c(ElP)\n8\n7.\n(3.65)\nWe can trust this estimate when ls \u226ar+ \u226aR, namely m8\nPl7\ns \u226aE \u226am8\nPR7. Compar-\ning this with the Hagedorn density of states in the regime (2) given by (3.61), we \ufb01nd\nthat the transition to (3.65) takes place at\nE \u223cms\ng2s\n.\n(3.66)\n93\n\n\nFor E \u226bm8\nPl7\ns, the entropy formula (3.65) is reliable and the black hole entropy exceeds\nthat of the gas of free strings. Therefore, in this regime, the Hilbert space is dominated\nby black hole states.\n(4) m8\nPR7 < E; Large Black Hole\nThe above analysis assumes that the size of the black hole, characterized by the\nhorizon radius r+, is small compared to the radii R of AdS5 and S5. As we increase\nthe energy, the radius r+ grows and eventually becomes comparable to R. Beyond this\npoint, we can no longer use the 10-dimensional Schwarzschild solution to estimate the\nnumber of states. According to (3.64), the horizon size becomes comparable to R when\nthe energy of the black hole reaches the scale E \u223cm8\nPR7. Beyond this energy scale,\nwe have to use a solution which is asymptotically AdS5 [289],\nds2 = \u2212f(r)d\u03c4 2 +\n1\nf(r)dr2 + r2d\u21262\n3,\n(3.67)\nwhere\nf(r) = 1 + r2\nR2 \u2212r2\n+\nr2\n \n1 + r2\n+\nR2\n!\n,\n(3.68)\nand r = r+ is the location of the out-most horizon.\nBy studying the asymptotic\nbehavior of the metric, one \ufb01nds that the black hole carries the energy\nE \u223cr2\n+\nl3\nP\n \n1 + r2\n+\nR2\n!\n.\n(3.69)\nHere lP is the \ufb01ve-dimensional Planck length, related to the 10-dimensional Planck\nscale lP and the compacti\ufb01cation scale R as\nl3\nP = l8\nPR\u22125.\n(3.70)\nThe entropy of the AdS Schwarzschild solution is given by\nS \u223c\n\u0012r+\nlP\n\u00133\n.\n(3.71)\nFor r+ \u226bR, (3.69) becomes E \u223cr4\n+l\u22123\nP R\u22122, and the entropy as a function of energy is\nS \u223c\n ER2\nlP\n! 3\n4\n=\n\u0012 R\nlP\n\u00132\n(ER)\n3\n4.\n(3.72)\nAs the energy increases, the horizon size expands as R \u226ar+ \u2192\u221e, and the supergrav-\nity approximation continues to be reliable. For E \u2192\u221e, the only stringy and quantum\ngravity corrections are due to the \ufb01nite size R of the AdS radius of curvature and of\n94\n\n\nthe compact space, and such corrections are suppressed by factors of ls/R and lP/R.\nThe leading ls/R corrections to (3.72) were studied in [290], and found to be of the\norder of (ls/R)3.\n\u25e6Summary\nThe above analysis gives the following picture about the structure of the Hilbert\nspace of string theory on AdS when ls \u226aR and gs \u226a1.\nS\nE\ngravitons\nfree\nfree strings\nsmall\nblack hole\nlarge\nblack hole\nE\nE\nE\nE\nR7\n9/10\n8/7\np\nm8 ls7\nmp8\nms9R8\n3/4\nFigure 3.5: The behavior of the entropy S as a function of the energy E in AdS5 .\n(1) For energies E \u226ams, the Hilbert space is the Fock space of supergravity particles\nand the spectrum is quantized in the unit of R\u22121.

We then\nhave to use the AdSp+2 Schwarzschild solution, and the entropy is given by:\nS \u223c\n\u0012 R\nlP\n\u00132\n(ER)\n3\n4.\n(3.76)\nThe behavior of the entropy is depicted in \ufb01gure 3.5.\nIn the small black hole regime (3), the system has a negative speci\ufb01c heat. This\ncorresponds to the well-known instability of the \ufb02at space at \ufb01nite temperature [291].\nOn the other hand, the AdS Schwarzschild solution has a positive speci\ufb01c heat and it\nis thermodynamically stable. This means that, if we consider a canonical ensemble,\nthe free string regime (2) and the small black hole regime (3) will be missed. When\nset in contact with a heat bath of temperature T \u223cms, the system will continue to\nabsorb heat until its energy reaches E \u223cm8\nPR7, the threshold of the large black hole\nregime (4). In fact the jump from (1) to (4) takes place at much lower temperature\nsince the temperature equivalent of E \u223cm8\nPR7 derived from (3.76) in the regime (4)\nis T \u223cR\u22121. Therefore, once the temperature is raised to T \u223cR\u22121 a black hole forms.\nThe behavior of the canonical ensemble will be discussed in more detail in section 3.6.\nFinally let us notice that in the case that gs \u223c1 we do not have the Hagedorn phase,\nand we go directly from the gas of gravitons to the small black hole phase.\n3.4.2\nHilbert Space of Conformal Field Theory\nNext, let us turn to a discussion of the Hilbert space of the CFTp+1. The generator\nJ0,p+2 = 1\n2(P0 + K0) is the Hamiltonian of the CFT on Sp with the unit radius. In\nthe Euclidean CFT, the conformal group SO(2, p + 1) turns into SO(1, p + 2) by the\nWick rotation, and the Hamiltonian 1\n2(P0 + K0) and the dilatation operator D can\nbe rotated into each other by an internal isomorphism of the group.\nTherefore, if\nthere is a conformal \ufb01eld \u03c6h(x) of dimension h with respect to the dilatation D, then\nthere is a corresponding eigenstate |h\u27e9of 1\n2(P0 + K0) on Sp with the same eigenvalue\nh. In two-dimensional conformal \ufb01eld theory, this phenomenon is well-known as the\nstate-operator correspondence, but in fact it holds for any CFTp+1 :\n\u03c6h(x) \u2192|h\u27e9= \u03c6h(x = 0)|0\u27e9.\n(3.77)\nAs discussed in section 3.2.1, in maximally supersymmetric cases there is a one-to-\none correspondence between chiral primary operators of CFTp+1 and the supergravity\nparticles on the dual AdSp+2 \u00d7 (compact space). This makes it possible to identify a\nstate in the Fock space of the supergravity particles on AdS with a state in the CFT\nHibert space generated by the chiral primary \ufb01elds.\n96\n\n\nTo be speci\ufb01c, let us consider the N = 4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory in four\ndimensions and its dual, type IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5. The string scale ms and\nthe 10-dimensional Planck scale mP are related to the gauge theory parameters, gY M\nand N, by\nms \u2243(g2\nY MN)\n1\n4R\u22121,\nmP \u2243N\n1\n4R\u22121.\n(3.78)\nThe four energy regimes of string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 are translated into the gauge\ntheory energy scales (measured in the units of the inverse S3 radius) in the \u2019t Hooft\nlimit as follows:\n(1) E \u226a(g2\nY MN)\n1\n4\nThe Hilbert space consists of the chiral primary states, their superconformal descen-\ndants and their products. Because of the large-N factorization, a product of gauge\ninvariant operators receives corrections only at subleading orders in the 1/N expan-\nsion. This \ufb01ts well with the supergravity description of multi-graviton states, where we\nestimated that their energy E becomes comparable to the gravitational potential when\nE \u223cm8\nPR7, which in the gauge theory scale corresponds to E \u223cN2. The entropy for\n1 \u226aE \u226a(g2\nY MN)\n1\n4 is then given by\nS \u223cE\n9\n10.\n(3.79)\n(2) (g2\nY MN)\n1\n4 < E \u226a(g2\nY MN)\u22127\n2N2\nEach single string state is identi\ufb01ed with a single trace operator in the gauge theory.\nSupergravity particles correspond to chiral primary states and stringy excitations to\nnon-chiral primaries. Since stringy excitations have an energy \u223cms, the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence requires that non-chiral conformal \ufb01elds have to have large anomalous\ndimensions \u2206\u223cmsR = (g2\nY MN)\n1\n4. In the \u2019t Hooft limit (N \u226b(g2\nY MN)\u03b3 for any \u03b3),\nwe can consider the regime (g2\nY MN)\n5\n2 < E \u226a(g2\nY MN)\u22127\n2N2 where the entropy shows\nthe Hagedorn behavior\nS \u223c(g2\nY MN)\u22121\n4E.\n(3.80)\nApparently, the entropy in this regime is dominated by the non-chiral \ufb01elds.\n(3) (g2\nY MN)\u22127\n2N2 < E < N2\nThe string theory Hilbert space consists of states in the small black hole.

The entropy\nis given by\nS \u223cN\n1\n2E\n3\n4.\n(3.82)\n97\n\n\nThe E\n3\n4 scaling of the entropy is what one expects for a conformal \ufb01eld theory in (3+1)\ndimensions at high energies (compared to the radius of the sphere). It is interesting\nto note that the N dependence of S is the same as that of N2 free particles in (3 + 1)\ndimensions, although the precise numerical coe\ufb03cient in S di\ufb00ers from the one that\nis obtained from the number of particles in the N = 4 Yang-Mills multiplet by a\nnumerical factor [292].\n3.5\nWilson Loops\nIn this section we consider Wilson loop operators in the gauge theory. The Wilson loop\noperator\nW(C) = Tr\n\u0014\nP exp\n\u0012\ni\nI\nC A\n\u0013\u0015\n(3.83)\ndepends on a loop C embedded in four dimensional space, and it involves the path-\nordered integral of the gauge connection along the contour. The trace is taken over\nsome representation of the gauge group; we will discuss here only the case of the\nfundamental representation (see [293] for a discussion of other representations). From\nthe expectation value of the Wilson loop operator \u27e8W(C)\u27e9we can calculate the quark-\nantiquark potential.\nFor this purpose we consider a rectangular loop with sides of\nlength T and L in Euclidean space. Then, viewing T as the time direction, it is clear\nthat for large T the expectation value will behave as e\u2212TE where E is the lowest possible\nenergy of the quark-anti-quark con\ufb01guration. Thus, we have\n\u27e8W\u27e9\u223ce\u2212TV (L) ,\n(3.84)\nwhere V (L) is the quark anti-quark potential.\nFor large N and large g2\nY MN, the\nAdS/CFT correspondence maps the computation of \u27e8W\u27e9in the CFT into a problem\nof \ufb01nding a minimum surface in AdS [294, 295].\n3.5.1\nWilson Loops and Minimum Surfaces\nIn QCD, we expect the Wilson loop to be related to the string running from the quark to\nthe antiquark. We expect this string to be analogous to the string in our con\ufb01guration,\nwhich is a superstring which lives in ten dimensions, and which can stretch between\ntwo points on the boundary of AdS.\nIn order to motivate this prescription let us\nconsider the following situation. We start with the gauge group U(N + 1), and we\nbreak it to U(N) \u00d7 U(1) by giving an expectation value to one of the scalars. This\ncorresponds, as discussed in section 3.1, to having a D3 brane sitting at some radial\nposition U in AdS, and at a point on S5. The o\ufb00-diagonal states, transforming in the\nN of U(N), get a mass proportional to U, m = U/2\u03c0. So, from the point of view of\n98\n\n\nthe U(N) gauge theory, we can view these states as massive quarks, which act as a\nsource for the various U(N) \ufb01elds. Since they are charged they will act as a source for\nthe vector \ufb01elds. In order to get a non-dynamical source (an \u201cexternal quark\u201d with no\n\ufb02uctuations of its own, which will correspond precisely to the Wilson loop operator)\nwe need to take m \u2192\u221e, which means U should also go to in\ufb01nity. Thus, the string\nshould end on the boundary of AdS space.\nThese stretched strings will also act as a source for the scalar \ufb01elds. The coupling to\nthe scalar \ufb01elds can be seen qualitatively by viewing the quarks as strings stretching\nbetween the N branes and the single separated brane. These strings will pull the N\nbranes and will cause a deformation of the branes, which is described by the scalar\n\ufb01elds. A more formal argument for this coupling is that these states are BPS, and\nthe coupling to the scalar (Higgs) \ufb01elds is determined by supersymmetry. Finally, one\ncan see this coupling explicitly by writing the full U(N + 1) Lagrangian, putting in\nthe Higgs expectation value and calculating the equation of motion for the massive\n\ufb01elds [294]. The precise de\ufb01nition of the Wilson loop operator corresponding to the\nsuperstring will actually include also the \ufb01eld theory fermions, which will imply some\nparticular boundary conditions for the worldsheet fermions at the boundary of AdS.\nHowever, this will not a\ufb00ect the leading order computations we describe here.\nSo, the \ufb01nal conclusion is that the stretched strings couple to the operator\nW(C) = Tr\n\u0014\nP exp\n\u0012I\n(iA\u00b5 \u02d9x\u00b5 + \u03b8I\u03c6I\u221a\n\u02d9x2)d\u03c4\n\u0013\u0015\n,\n(3.85)\nwhere x\u00b5(\u03c4) is any parametrization of the loop and \u03b8I (I = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 6) is a unit vector in\nR6 (the point on S5 where the string is sitting). This is the expression when the signa-\nture of R4 is Euclidean. In the Minkowski signature case, the phase factor associated\nto the trajectory of the quark has an extra factor \u201ci\u201d in front of \u03b8I 11.\nGeneralizing the prescription of section 3.3 for computing correlation functions, the\ndiscussion above implies that in order to compute the expectation value of the operator\n(3.85) in N = 4 SYM we should consider the string theory partition function on\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5, with the condition that we have a string worldsheet ending on the loop C,\nas in \ufb01gure 3.6 [295, 294]. In the supergravity regime, when gsN is large, the leading\ncontribution to this partition function will come from the area of the string worldsheet.\nThis area is measured with the AdS metric, and it is generally not the same as the\narea enclosed by the loop C in four dimensions.\nThe area as de\ufb01ned above is divergent. The divergence arises from the fact that\nthe string worldsheet is going all the way to the boundary of AdS. If we evaluate\nthe area up to some radial distance U = r, we see that for large r it diverges as\n11The di\ufb00erence in the factor of i between the Euclidean and the Minkowski cases can be traced to\nthe analytic continuation of\n\u221a\n\u02d9x2. A detailed derivation of (3.85) can be found in [296].\n99\n\n\nFigure 3.6: The Wilson loop operator creates a string worldsheet ending on the corre-\nsponding loop on the boundary of AdS.\nr|C|, where |C| is the length of the loop in the \ufb01eld theory [294, 295]. On the other\nhand, the perturbative computation in the \ufb01eld theory shows that \u27e8W\u27e9, for W given\nby (3.85), is \ufb01nite, as it should be since a divergence in the Wilson loop would have\nimplied a mass renormalization of the BPS particle. The apparent discrepancy between\nthe divergence of the area of the minimum surface in AdS and the \ufb01niteness of the\n\ufb01eld theory computation can be reconciled by noting that the appropriate action for\nthe string worldsheet is not the area itself but its Legendre transform with respect to\nthe string coordinates corresponding to \u03b8I and the radial coordinate u [296]. This is\nbecause these string coordinates obey the Neumann boundary conditions rather than\nthe Dirichlet conditions. When the loop is smooth, the Legendre transformation simply\nsubtracts the divergent term r|C|, leaving the resulting action \ufb01nite.\nAs an example let us consider a circular Wilson loop. Take C to be a circle of radius\na on the boundary, and let us work in the Poincar\u00b4e coordinates (de\ufb01ned in section\n2.2). We could \ufb01nd the surface that minimizes the area by solving the Euler-Lagrange\nequations. However, in this case it is easier to use conformal invariance. Note that\nthere is a conformal transformation in the \ufb01eld theory that maps a line to a circle. In\nthe case of the line, the minimum area surface is clearly a plane that intersects the\nboundary and goes all the way to the horizon (which is just a point on the boundary\nin the Euclidean case). Using the conformal transformation to map the line to a circle\nwe obtain the minimal surface we want. It is, using the coordinates (3.17) for AdS5,\n\u20d7x =\n\u221a\na2 \u2212z2(\u20d7e1 cos \u03b8 + \u20d7e2 sin \u03b8),\n(3.86)\nwhere \u20d7e1, \u20d7e2 are two orthonormal vectors in four dimensions (which de\ufb01ne the orien-\ntation of the circle) and 0 \u2264z \u2264a. We can calculate the area of this surface in AdS,\nand we get a contribution to the action\nS \u223c\n1\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032A = R2\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nZ\nd\u03b8\nZ a\n\u01eb\ndza\nz2 = R2\n\u03b1\u2032 (a\n\u01eb \u22121),\n(3.87)\n100\n\n\nwhere we have regularized the area by putting a an IR cuto\ufb00at z = \u01eb in AdS, which\nis equivalent to a UV cuto\ufb00in the \ufb01eld theory [175]. Subtracting the divergent term\nwe get\n\u27e8W\u27e9\u223ce\u2212S \u223ceR2/\u03b1\u2032 = e\n\u221a4\u03c0gsN.\n(3.88)\nThis is independent of a as required by conformal invariance.\nWe could similarly consider a \u201cmagnetic\u201d Wilson loop, which is also called a \u2019t Hooft\nloop [297]. This case is related by electric-magnetic duality to the previous case. Since\nwe identify the electric-magnetic duality with the SL(2, Z) duality of type IIB string\ntheory, we should consider in this case a D-string worldsheet instead of a fundamental\nstring worldsheet. We get the same result as in (3.88) but with gs \u21921/gs.\nUsing (3.84) it is possible to compute the quark-antiquark potential in the supergrav-\nity approximation [295, 294]. In this case we consider a con\ufb01guration which is invariant\nunder (Euclidean) time translations. We take both particles to have the same scalar\ncharge, which means that the two ends of the string are at the same point in S5 (one\ncould consider also the more general case with a string ending at di\ufb00erent points on S5\n[294]). We put the quark at x = \u2212L/2 and the anti-quark at x = L/2. Here \u201cquark\u201d\nmeans an in\ufb01nitely massive W-boson connecting the N branes with one brane which\nis (in\ufb01nitely) far away. The classical action for a string worldsheet is\nS =\n1\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nZ\nd\u03c4d\u03c3\nq\ndet(GMN\u2202\u03b1XM\u2202\u03b2XN),\n(3.89)\nwhere GMN is the Euclidean AdS5 \u00d7 S5 metric. Note that the factors of \u03b1\u2032 cancel\nout in (3.89), as they should. Since we are interested in a static con\ufb01guration we take\n\u03c4 = t, \u03c3 = x, and then the action becomes\nS = TR2\n2\u03c0\nZ L/2\n\u2212L/2 dx\nq\n(\u2202xz)2 + 1\nz2\n.\n(3.90)\nWe need to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations for this action. Since the action does\nnot depend on x explicitly the solution satis\ufb01es\n1\nz2\nq\n(\u2202xz)2 + 1\n= constant.\n(3.91)\nDe\ufb01ning z0 to be the maximum value of z(x), which by symmetry occurs at x = 0, we\n\ufb01nd that the solution is12\nx = z0\nZ 1\nz/z0\ndyy2\n\u221a1 \u2212y4,\n(3.92)\n12All integrals in this section can be calculated in terms of elliptic or Beta functions.\n101\n\n\nwhere z0 is determined by the condition\nL\n2 = z0\nZ 1\n0\ndyy2\n\u221a1 \u2212y4 = z0\n\u221a\n2\u03c03/2\n\u0393(1/4)2.\n(3.93)\nThe qualitative form of the solution is shown in \ufb01gure 3.7(b). Notice that the string\nquickly approaches x = L/2 for small z (close to the boundary),\nL\n2 \u2212x \u223cz3 ,\nz \u21920 .\n(3.94)\nNow we compute the total energy of the con\ufb01guration. We just plug in the solution\n(3.92) in (3.90), subtract the in\ufb01nity as explained above (which can be interpreted as\nthe energy of two separated massive quarks, as in \ufb01gure 3.7(a)), and we \ufb01nd\nE = V (L) = \u22124\u03c02(2g2\nY MN)1/2\n\u0393( 1\n4)4L\n.\n(3.95)\nWe see that the energy goes as 1/L, a fact which is determined by conformal invariance.\nNote that the energy is proportional to (g2\nY MN)1/2, as opposed to g2\nY MN which is the\nperturbative result. This indicates some screening of the charges at strong coupling.\nThe above calculation makes sense for all distances L when gsN is large, independently\nof the value of gs. Some subleading corrections coming from quantum \ufb02uctuations of\nthe worldsheet were calculated in [298, 299, 300].\nIn a similar fashion we could compute the potential between two magnetic monopoles\nin terms of a D-string worldsheet, and the result will be the same as (3.95) but with\ngY M \u21924\u03c0/gY M. One can also calculate the interaction between a magnetic monopole\nand a quark. In this case the fundamental string (ending on the quark) will attach to\nthe D-string (ending on the monopole), and they will connect to form a (1, 1) string\nwhich will go into the horizon. The resulting potential is a complicated function of\ngY M [301], but in the limit that gY M is small (but still with g2\nY MN large) we get\nthat the monopole-quark potential is just 1/4 of the quark-quark potential. This can\nbe understood from the fact that when g is small the D-string is very rigid and the\nfundamental string will end almost perpendicularly on the D-string. Therefore, the\nsolution for the fundamental string will be half of the solution we had above, leading\nto a factor of 1/4 in the potential. Calculations of Wilson loops in the Higgs phase\nwere done in [302].\nAnother interesting case one can study analytically is a surface near a cusp on R4.\nIn this case, the perturbative computation in the gauge theory shows a logarithmic\ndivergence with a coe\ufb03cient depending on the angle at the cusp.\nThe area of the\nminimum surface also contains a logarithmic divergence depending on the angle [296].\nOther aspects of the gravity calculation of Wilson loops were discussed in [303, 304,\n305, 306, 307].\n102\n\n\nL\nU=0\nU=\n8\n(a)\n(b)\nx\nU\nFigure 3.7: (a) Initial con\ufb01guration corresponding to two massive quarks before we\nturn on their coupling to the U(N) gauge theory. (b) Con\ufb01guration after we consider\nthe coupling to the U(N) gauge theory. This con\ufb01guration minimizes the action. The\nquark-antiquark energy is given by the di\ufb00erence of the total length of the strings in\n(a) and (b).\n3.5.2\nOther Branes Ending on the Boundary\nWe could also consider other branes that are ending at the boundary [308].\nThe\nsimplest example would be a zero-brane (i.e. a particle) of mass m. In Euclidean\nspace a zero-brane describes a one dimensional trajectory in anti-de-Sitter space which\nends at two points on the boundary. Therefore, it is associated with the insertion of\ntwo local operators at the two points where the trajectory ends. In the supergravity\napproximation the zero-brane follows a geodesic. Geodesics in the hyperbolic plane\n(Euclidean AdS) are semicircles. If we compute the action we get\nS = m\nZ\nds = \u22122mR\nZ a\n\u01eb\nadz\nz\n\u221a\na2 \u2212z2,\n(3.96)\nwhere we took the distance between the two points at the boundary to be L = 2a and\nregulated the result. We \ufb01nd a logarithmic divergence when \u01eb \u21920, proportional to\nlog(\u01eb/a). If we subtract the logarithmic divergence we get a residual dependence on a.\nNaively we might have thought that (as in the previous subsection) the answer had to\nbe independent of a due to conformal invariance. In fact, the dependence on a is very\nimportant, since it leads to a result of the form\ne\u2212S \u223ce\u22122mR log a \u223c\n1\na2mR ,\n(3.97)\n103\n\n\nwhich is precisely the result we expect for the two-point function of an operator of\ndimension \u2206= mR. This is precisely the large mR limit of the formula (3.14), so\nwe reproduce in the supergravity limit the 2-point function described in section 3.3.\nIn general, this sort of logarithmic divergence arises when the brane worldvolume is\nodd dimensional [308], and it implies that the expectation value of the corresponding\noperator depends on the overall scale. In particular one could consider the \u201cWilson\nsurfaces\u201d that arise in the six dimensional N = (2, 0) theory which will be discussed in\nsection 6.1.1. In that case one has to consider a two-brane, with a three dimensional\nworldvolume, ending on a two dimensional surface on the boundary of AdS7. Again,\none gets a logarithmic term, which is proportional to the rigid string action of the two\ndimensional surface living on the string in the N = (2, 0) \ufb01eld theory [309, 308].\nOne can also compute correlation functions involving more than one Wilson loop.\nTo leading order in N this will be just the product of the expectation values of each\nWilson loop. On general grounds one expects that the subleading corrections are given\nby surfaces that end on more than one loop. One limiting case is when the surfaces look\nsimilar to the zeroth order surfaces but with additional thin tubes connecting them.\nThese thin tubes are nothing else than massless particles being exchanged between the\ntwo string worldsheets [293, 309]. We will discuss this further in section 6.2.\n3.6\nTheories at Finite Temperature\nAs discussed in section 3.2, the quantities that can be most successfully compared\nbetween gauge theory and string theory are those with some protection from super-\nsymmetry and/or conformal invariance \u2014 for instance, dimensions of chiral primary\noperators. Finite temperature breaks both supersymmetry and conformal invariance,\nand the insights we gain from examining the T > 0 physics will be of a more qualita-\ntive nature. They are no less interesting for that: we shall see in section 3.6.1 how the\nentropy of near-extremal D3-branes comes out identical to the free \ufb01eld theory pre-\ndiction up to a factor of a power of 4/3; then in section 3.6.2 we explain how a phase\ntransition studied by Hawking and Page in the context of quantum gravity is mapped\ninto a con\ufb01nement-decon\ufb01nement transition in the gauge theory, driven by \ufb01nite-size\ne\ufb00ects; and in section 6.2 we will summarize the attempts to use holographic duals of\n\ufb01nite-temperature \ufb01eld theories to learn about pure gauge theory at zero temperature\nbut in one lower dimension.\n3.6.1\nConstruction\nThe gravity solution describing the gauge theory at \ufb01nite temperature can be obtained\nby starting from the general black three-brane solution (1.12) and taking the decoupling\n104\n\n\nlimit of section 3.1 keeping the energy density above extremality \ufb01nite. The resulting\nmetric can be written as\nds2 = R2\n\"\nu2(\u2212hdt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2 + dx2\n3) + du2\nhu2 + d\u21262\n5\n#\nh = 1 \u2212u4\n0\nu4 ,\nu0 = \u03c0T.\n(3.98)\nIt will often be useful to Wick rotate by setting tE = it, and use the relation between\nthe \ufb01nite temperature theory and the Euclidean theory with a compact time direction.\nThe \ufb01rst computation which indicated that \ufb01nite-temperature U(N) Yang-Mills the-\nory might be a good description of the microstates of N coincident D3-branes was the\ncalculation of the entropy [292, 310]. On the supergravity side, the entropy of near-\nextremal D3-branes is just the usual Bekenstein-Hawking result, S = A/4GN, and it\nis expected to be a reliable guide to the entropy of the gauge theory at large N and\nlarge g2\nY MN. There is no problem on the gauge theory side in working at large N,\nbut large g2\nY MN at \ufb01nite temperature is di\ufb03cult indeed. The analysis of [292] was\nlimited to a free \ufb01eld computation in the \ufb01eld theory, but nevertheless the two results\nfor the entropy agreed up to a factor of a power of 4/3. In the canonical ensemble,\nwhere temperature and volume are the independent variables, one identi\ufb01es the \ufb01eld\ntheory volume with the world-volume of the D3-branes, and one sets the \ufb01eld theory\ntemperature equal to the Hawking temperature in supergravity. The result is\nFSUGRA = \u2212\u03c02\n8 N2V T 4,\nFSY M = 4\n3FSUGRA .\n(3.99)\nThe supergravity result is at leading order in ls/R, and it would acquire corrections\nsuppressed by powers of TR if we had considered the full D3-brane metric rather than\nthe near-horizon limit, (3.98). These corrections do not have an interpretation in the\ncontext of CFT because they involve R as an intrinsic scale. Two equivalent methods\nto evaluate FSUGRA are a) to use F = E \u2212TS together with standard expressions for\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the Hawking temperature, and the ADM mass; and\nb) to consider the gravitational action of the Euclidean solution, with a periodicity in\nthe Euclidean time direction (related to the temperature) which eliminates a conical\nde\ufb01cit angle at the horizon.13\nThe 4/3 factor is a long-standing puzzle into which we still have only qualitative in-\nsight. The gauge theory computation was performed at zero \u2019t Hooft coupling, whereas\n13The result of [292], SSY M = (4/3)1/4SSUGRA, di\ufb00ers super\ufb01cially from (3.99), but it is only\nbecause the authors worked in the microcanonical ensemble: rather than identifying the Hawking\ntemperature with the \ufb01eld theory temperature, the ADM mass above extremality was identi\ufb01ed with\nthe \ufb01eld theory energy.\n105\n\n\nthe supergravity is supposed to be valid at strong \u2019t Hooft coupling, and unlike in the\n1+1-dimensional case where the entropy is essentially \ufb01xed by the central charge, there\nis no non-renormalization theorem for the coe\ufb03cient of T 4 in the free energy. Indeed,\nit was suggested in [290] that the leading term in the 1/N expansion of F has the form\nF = \u2212f(g2\nY MN)\u03c02\n6 N2V T 4,\n(3.100)\nwhere f(g2\nY MN) is a function which smoothly interpolates between a weak coupling\nlimit of 1 and a strong coupling limit of 3/4. It was pointed out early [311] that the\nquartic potential g2\nY MTr[\u03c6I, \u03c6J]2 in the N = 4 Yang-Mills action might be expected\nto freeze out more and more degrees of freedom as the coupling was increased, which\nwould suggest that f(g2\nY MN) is monotone decreasing. An argument has been given\n[312], based on the non-renormalization of the two-point function of the stress tensor,\nthat f(g2\nY MN) should remain \ufb01nite at strong coupling.\nThe leading corrections to the limiting value of f(g2\nY MN) at strong and weak coupling\nwere computed in [290] and [313], respectively. The results are\nf(g2\nY MN) = 1 \u2212\n3\n2\u03c02g2\nY MN + . . .\nfor small g2\nY MN,\nf(g2\nY MN) = 3\n4 + 45\n32\n\u03b6(3)\n(g2\nY MN)3/2 + . . .\nfor large g2\nY MN.\n(3.101)\nThe weak coupling result is a straightforward although somewhat tedious application\nof the diagrammatic methods of perturbative \ufb01nite-temperature \ufb01eld theory.\nThe\nconstant term is from one loop, and the leading correction is from two loops. The strong\ncoupling result follows from considering the leading \u03b1\u2032 corrections to the supergravity\naction. The relevant one involves a particular contraction of four powers of the Weyl\ntensor. It is important now to work with the Euclidean solution, and one restricts\nattention further to the near-horizon limit. The Weyl curvature comes from the non-\ncompact part of the metric, which is no longer AdS5 but rather the AdS-Schwarzschild\nsolution which we will discuss in more detail in section 3.6.2. The action including\nthe \u03b1\u2032 corrections no longer has the Einstein-Hilbert form, and correspondingly the\nBekenstein-Hawking prescription no longer agrees with the free energy computed as \u03b2I\nwhere I is the Euclidean action. In keeping with the basic prescription for computing\nGreen\u2019s functions, where a free energy in \ufb01eld theory is equated (in the appropriate\nlimit) with a supergravity action, the relation I = \u03b2F is regarded as the correct\none. (See [314].) It has been conjectured that the interpolating function f(g2\nY MN)\nis not smooth, but exhibits some phase transition at a \ufb01nite value of the \u2019t Hooft\ncoupling. We regard this as an unsettled question. The arguments in [315, 316] seem\nas yet incomplete. In particular, they rely on analyticity properties of the perturbation\nexpansion which do not seem to be proven for \ufb01nite temperature \ufb01eld theories.\n106\n\n\n3.6.2\nThermal Phase Transition\nThe holographic prescription of [19, 20], applied at large N and g2\nY MN where loop and\nstringy corrections are negligible, involves extremizing the supergravity action subject\nto particular asymptotic boundary conditions. We can think of this as the saddle point\napproximation to the path integral over supergravity \ufb01elds. That path integral is ill-\nde\ufb01ned because of the non-renormalizable nature of supergravity. String amplitudes\n(when we can calculate them) render on-shell quantities well-de\ufb01ned. Despite the con-\nceptual di\ufb03culties we can use some simple intuition about path integrals to illustrate\nan important point about the AdS/CFT correspondence: namely, there can be more\nthan one saddle point in the range of integration, and when there is we should sum\ne\u2212ISUGRA over the classical con\ufb01gurations to obtain the saddle-point approximation to\nthe gauge theory partition function. Multiple classical con\ufb01gurations are possible be-\ncause of the general feature of boundary value problems in di\ufb00erential equations: there\ncan be multiple solutions to the classical equations satisfying the same asymptotic\nboundary conditions. The solution which globally minimizes ISUGRA is the one that\ndominates the path integral.\nWhen there are two or more solutions competing to minimize ISUGRA, there can\nbe a phase transition between them. An example of this was studied in [289] long\nbefore the AdS/CFT correspondence, and subsequently resurrected, generalized, and\nreinterpreted in [20, 185] as a con\ufb01nement-decon\ufb01nement transition in the gauge theory.\nSince the qualitative features are independent of the dimension, we will restrict our\nattention to AdS5. It is worth noting however that if the AdS5 geometry is part of a\nstring compacti\ufb01cation, it doesn\u2019t matter what the internal manifold is except insofar\nas it \ufb01xes the cosmological constant, or equivalently the radius R of anti-de Sitter\nspace.\nThere is an embedding of the Schwarzschild black hole solution into anti-de Sitter\nspace which extremizes the action\nI = \u2212\n1\n16\u03c0G5\nZ\nd5x \u221ag\n\u0012\nR + 12\nR2\n\u0013\n.\n(3.102)\nExplicitly, the metric is\nds2 = fdt2 + 1\nf dr2 + r2d\u21262\n3,\nf = 1 + r2\nR2 \u2212\u00b5\nr2 .\n(3.103)\nThe radial variable r is restricted to r \u2265r+, where r+ is the largest root of f = 0. The\nEuclidean time is periodically identi\ufb01ed, t \u223ct + \u03b2, in order to eliminate the conical\n107\n\n\nsingularity at r = r+. This requires\n\u03b2 = 2\u03c0R2r+\n2r2+ + R2 .\n(3.104)\nTopologically, this space is S3 \u00d7B2, and the boundary is S3 \u00d7S1 (which is the relevant\nspace for the \ufb01eld theory on S3 with \ufb01nite temperature). We will call this space X2.\nAnother space with the same boundary which is also a local extremum of (3.102) is\ngiven by the metric in (3.103) with \u00b5 = 0 and again with periodic time. This space,\nwhich we will call X1, is not only metrically distinct from the \ufb01rst (being locally con-\nformally \ufb02at), but also topologically B4 \u00d7 S1 rather than S3 \u00d7 B2. Because the S1\nfactor is not simply connected, there are two possible spin structures on X1, corre-\nsponding to thermal (anti-periodic) or supersymmetric (periodic) boundary conditions\non fermions.\nIn contrast, X2 is simply connected and hence admits a unique spin\nstructure, corresponding to thermal boundary conditions. For the purpose of comput-\ning the twisted partition function, Tr(\u22121)Fe\u2212\u03b2H, in a saddle-point approximation, only\nX1 contributes. But, X1 and X2 make separate saddle-point contributions to the usual\nthermal partition function, Tre\u2212\u03b2H, and the more important one is the one with the\nsmaller Euclidean action.\nActually, both I(X1) and I(X2) are in\ufb01nite, so to compute I(X2)\u2212I(X1) a regulation\nscheme must be adopted. The one used in [185, 290] is to cut o\ufb00both X1 and X2 at a\nde\ufb01nite coordinate radius r = R0. For X2, the elimination of the conical de\ufb01cit angle\nat the horizon \ufb01xes the period of Euclidean time; but for X1, the period is arbitrary.\nIn order to make the comparison of I(X1) and I(X2) meaningful, we \ufb01x the period of\nEuclidean time on X1 so that the proper circumference of the S1 at r = R0 is the same\nas the proper length on X2 of an orbit of the Killing vector \u2202/\u2202t, also at r = R0. In\nthe limit R0 \u2192\u221e, one \ufb01nds\nI(X2) \u2212I(X1) = \u03c02r3\n+(R2 \u2212r2\n+)\n4G5(2r2\n+ + R2) ,\n(3.105)\nwhere again r+ is the largest root of f = 0. The fact that (3.105) (or more precisely\nits AdS4 analog) can change its sign was interpreted in [289] as indicating a phase\ntransition between a black hole in AdS and a thermal gas of particles in AdS (which\nis the natural interpretation of the space X1). The black hole is the thermodynam-\nically favored state when the horizon radius r+ exceeds the radius of curvature R of\nAdS. In the gauge theory we interpret this transition as a con\ufb01nement-decon\ufb01nement\ntransition. Since the theory is conformally invariant, the transition temperature must\nbe proportional to the inverse radius of the space S3 which the \ufb01eld theory lives on.\nSimilar transitions, and also local thermodynamic instability due to negative speci\ufb01c\nheats, have been studied in the context of spinning branes and charged black holes\n108\n\n\nin [317, 318, 319, 142, 141, 320, 321]. Most of these works are best understood on\nthe CFT side as explorations of exotic thermal phenomena in \ufb01nite-temperature gauge\ntheories. Connections with Higgsed states in gauge theory are clearer in [322, 323].\nThe relevance to con\ufb01nement is explored in [320]. See also [324, 325, 326, 285] for\nother interesting contributions to the \ufb01nite temperature literature.\nDecon\ufb01nement at high temperature can be characterized by a spontaneous breaking\nof the center of the gauge group. In our case the gauge group is SU(N) and its center\nis ZN. The order parameter for the breaking of the center is the expectation value of\nthe Polyakov (temporal) loop \u27e8W(C)\u27e9. The boundary of the spaces X1, X2 is S3 \u00d7 S1,\nand the path C wraps around the circle. An element of the center g \u2208ZN acts on the\nPolyakov loop by \u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u2192g\u27e8W(C)\u27e9. The expectation value of the Polyakov loop\nmeasures the change of the free energy of the system Fq(T) induced by the presence\nof the external charge q, \u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u223cexp (\u2212Fq(T)/T). In a con\ufb01ning phase Fq(T) is\nin\ufb01nite and therefore \u27e8W(C)\u27e9= 0. In the decon\ufb01ned phase Fq(T) is \ufb01nite and therefore\n\u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u0338= 0.\nAs discussed in section 3.5, in order to compute \u27e8W(C)\u27e9we have to evaluate the\npartition function of strings with a worldsheet D that is bounded by the loop C.\nConsider \ufb01rst the low temperature phase. The relevant space is X1 which, as discussed\nabove, has the topology B4 \u00d7S1. The contour C wraps the circle and is not homotopic\nto zero in X1. Therefore C is not a boundary of any D, which immediately implies\nthat \u27e8W(C)\u27e9= 0. This is the expected behavior at low temperatures (compared to\nthe inverse radius of the S3), where the center of the gauge group is not broken.\nFor the high temperature phase the relevant space is X2, which has the topology\nS3 \u00d7 B2. The contour C is now a boundary of a string worldsheet D = B2 (times a\npoint in S3). This seems to be in agreement with the fact that in the high temperature\nphase \u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u0338= 0 and the center of the gauge group is broken. It was pointed out\nin [185] that there is a subtlety with this argument, since the center should not be\nbroken in \ufb01nite volume (S3), but only in the in\ufb01nite volume limit (R3). Indeed, the\nsolution X2 is not unique and we can add to it an expectation value for the integral\nof the NS-NS 2-form \ufb01eld B on B2, with vanishing \ufb01eld strength. This is an angular\nparameter \u03c8 with period 2\u03c0, which contributes i\u03c8 to the string worldsheet action. The\nstring theory partition function includes now an integral over all values of \u03c8, making\n\u27e8W(C)\u27e9= 0 on S3. In contrast, on R3 one integrates over the local \ufb02uctuations of\n\u03c8 but not over its vacuum expectation value. Now \u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u0338= 0 and depends on the\nvalue of \u03c8 \u2208U(1), which may be understood as the dependence on the center ZN in\nthe large N limit. Explicit computations of Polyakov loops at \ufb01nite temperature were\ndone in [327, 328].\nIn [185] the Euclidean black hole solution (3.103) was suggested to be holographically\ndual to a theory related to pure QCD in three dimensions. In the large volume limit\n109\n\n\nthe solution corresponds to the N = 4 gauge theory on R3 \u00d7S1 with thermal boundary\nconditions, and when the S1 is made small (corresponding to high temperature T) the\ntheory at distances larger than 1/T e\ufb00ectively reduces to pure Yang-Mills on R3. Some\nof the non-trivial successes of this approach to QCD will be discussed in section 6.2.\n110\n\n\nChapter 4\nMore on the Correspondence\n4.1\nOther AdS5 Backgrounds\nUp to now we have limited our discussion to the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background of type IIB\nstring theory; in section 4.3 we will describe backgrounds which are related to it by\ndeformations. However, it is clear from the description of the correspondence in sections\n3.1 and 3.3 that a similar correspondence may be de\ufb01ned for any theory of quantum\ngravity whose metric includes an AdS5 factor; the generalization of equation (3.13)\nrelates such a theory to a four dimensional conformal \ufb01eld theory. The background\ndoes not necessarily have to be of the form AdS5 \u00d7 X; it is enough that it has an\nSO(4, 2) isometry symmetry, and more general possibilities in which the curvature of\nAdS5 depends on the position in X are also possible [121]. It is necessary, however,\nfor the AdS theory to be a theory of quantum gravity, since any conformal theory\nhas an energy-momentum tensor operator that is mapped by the correspondence to\nthe graviton on AdS51.\nThus, we would like to discuss compacti\ufb01cations of string\ntheory or M theory, which are believed to be consistent theories of quantum gravity,\non backgrounds involving AdS5. For simplicity we will only discuss here backgrounds\nwhich are direct products of the form AdS5 \u00d7 X.\nGiven such a background of string/M theory, it is not apriori clear what is the\nconformal \ufb01eld theory to which it corresponds.\nA special class of backgrounds are\nthose which arise as near-horizon limits of branes, like the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background.\nIn this case one can sometimes analyze the low-energy \ufb01eld theory on the branes by\nstandard methods before taking the near-horizon limit, and after the limit this becomes\nthe dual conformal \ufb01eld theory. The most well-studied case is the case of D3-branes\nin type IIB string theory. When the D3-branes are at a generic point in space-time\n1If we have a topological \ufb01eld theory on the boundary the bulk theory does not have to be gravi-\ntational, as in [329].\n111\n\n\nthe near-horizon limit gives the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background discussed extensively above.\nHowever, if the transverse space to the D3-branes is singular, the near-horizon limit\nand the corresponding \ufb01eld theory can be di\ufb00erent. The simplest case is the case of a\nD3-brane on an orbifold [330] or orientifold [216] singularity, which can be analyzed by\nperturbative string theory methods. These cases will be discussed in sections 4.1.1 and\n4.1.2. Another interesting case is the conifold singularity [217] and its generalizations,\nwhich will be discussed in section 4.1.3. In this case a direct analysis of the \ufb01eld theory\nis not possible, but various indirect arguments can be used to determine what it is in\nmany cases.\nNot much is known about more general cases of near-horizon limits of D3-branes,\nwhich on the string theory side were analyzed in [331, 332, 333, 334, 335], and even\nless is known about backgrounds which are not describable as near-horizon limits of\nbranes (several AdS5 backgrounds were discussed in [336]). An example of the latter\nis the AdS5 \u00d7 CP3 background of M theory [337], which involves a 4-form \ufb02ux on the\n4-cycle in CP3. Using the methods described in the previous sections we can compute\nvarious properties of such compacti\ufb01cations in the large N limit, such as the mass\nspectrum and the central charge of the corresponding \ufb01eld theories (for the AdS5\u00d7CP3\ncompacti\ufb01cation one \ufb01nds a central charge proportional to N3, where N is the 4-form\n\ufb02ux). However, it is not known how to construct an alternative description of the\nconformal \ufb01eld theory in most of these cases, except for the cases which are related by\ndeformations to the better-understood orbifold and conifold compacti\ufb01cations.\nSome of the AdS5 \u00d7 X backgrounds of string/M theory preserve some number of\nsupersymmetries, but most of them (such as the AdS5 \u00d7 CP3 background) do not.\nIn supersymmetric cases, supersymmetry guarantees the stability of the corresponding\nsolutions. In the non-supersymmetric cases various instabilities may arise for \ufb01nite N\n(see, for instance, [338, 339]) which may destroy the conformal (SO(4, 2)) invariance,\nbut the correspondence is still conjectured to be valid when all quantum corrections\nare taken into account (or in the in\ufb01nite N limit for which the supergravity approxima-\ntion is valid). One type of instability occurs when the spectrum includes a tachyonic\n\ufb01eld whose mass is below the Breitenlohner-Freedman stability bound. Such a \ufb01eld is\nexpected to condense just like a tachyon in \ufb02at space, and generally it is not known\nwhat this condensation leads to. If the classical supergravity spectrum includes a \ufb01eld\nwhich saturates the stability bound, an analysis of the quantum corrections is neces-\nsary to determine whether they raise the mass squared of the \ufb01eld (leading to a stable\nsolution) or lower it (leading to an unstable solution). Apriori one would not expect\nto have a \ufb01eld which exactly saturates the bound (corresponding to an operator in\nthe \ufb01eld theory whose dimension is exactly \u2206= 2) in a non-supersymmetric theory,\nbut this often happens in orbifold theories for reasons that will be discussed below.\nAnother possible instability arises when there is a massless \ufb01eld in the background,\n112\n\n\ncorresponding to a marginal operator in the \ufb01eld theory. Such a \ufb01eld (the dilaton)\nexists in all classical type IIB compacti\ufb01cations, and naively corresponds to an exactly\nmarginal deformation of the theory even in the non-supersymmetric cases. However,\nfor \ufb01nite N one would expect quantum corrections to generate a potential for such a\n\ufb01eld (if it is neutral under the gauge symmetries), which could drive its expectation\nvalue away from the range of values where the supergravity approximation is valid.\nAgain, an analysis of the quantum corrections is necessary in such a case to determine\nif the theory has a stable vacuum (which may or may not be describable in supergrav-\nity), corresponding to a \ufb01xed point of the corresponding \ufb01eld theory, or if the potential\nleads to a runaway behavior with no stable vacuum. Another possible source of insta-\nbilities is related to the possibility of forming brane-anti-brane pairs in the vacuum (or,\nequivalently, the emission of branes which destabilize the vacuum) [340, 341, 342, 343];\none would expect such an instability to arise, for example, in cases where we look at\nthe near-horizon limit of N 3-branes which have a repulsive force between them. For\nall these reasons, the study of non-supersymmetric backgrounds usually requires an\nunderstanding of the quantum corrections, which are not yet well-understood either in\nM theory or in type IIB compacti\ufb01cations with RR backgrounds. Thus, we will focus\nhere on supersymmetric backgrounds, for which the supergravity approximation is gen-\nerally valid. In the non-supersymmetric cases the correspondence is still expected to\nbe valid, and in the extreme large N limit it can also be studied using supergravity, but\ngetting \ufb01nite N information usually requires going beyond the SUGRA approximation.\nIt would be very interesting to understand better the quantum corrections in order to\nstudy non-supersymmetric theories at \ufb01nite N using the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n4.1.1\nOrbifolds of AdS5 \u00d7 S5\nThe low-energy \ufb01eld theory corresponding to D3-branes at orbifold singularities may be\nderived by string theory methods [344, 345]. Generally the gauge group is of the form\nQ\ni U(aiN), and there are various bifundamental (and sometimes also adjoint) matter\n\ufb01elds2. We are interested in the near-horizon limit of D3-branes sitting at the origin of\nR4 \u00d7R6/\u0393 for some \ufb01nite group \u0393 which is a discrete subgroup of the SO(6) \u2243SU(4)R\nrotation symmetry [330]. If \u0393 \u2282SU(3) \u2282SU(4)R the theory on the D3-branes has\nN = 1 supersymmetry, and if \u0393 \u2282SU(2) \u2282SU(4)R it has N = 2 supersymmetry. The\nnear-horizon limit of such a con\ufb01guration is of the form AdS5\u00d7S5/\u0393 (since the orbifold\ncommutes with taking the near-horizon limit), and corresponds (at least for large N)\n2In general one can choose to have the orbifold group act on the Chan-Paton indices in various\nways. We will discuss here only the case where the group acts as N copies of the regular representation\nof the orbifold group \u0393, which is the only case which leads to conformal theories. Other representations\ninvolve also 5-branes wrapped around 2-cycles, so they do not arise in the naive near-horizon limit of\nD3-branes. The AdS5 description of this was given in [218].\n113\n\n\nto a conformal theory with the appropriate amount of supersymmetry. Note that on\nneither side of the correspondence is the orbifolding just a projection on the \u0393-invariant\nstates of the original theory \u2013 on the string theory side we need to add also twisted\nsectors, while on the \ufb01eld theory side the gauge group is generally much larger (though\nthe \ufb01eld theory can be viewed as a projection of the gauge theory corresponding to\ndim(\u0393) \u00b7 N D-branes).\nWe will start with a general analysis of the orbifold, and then discuss speci\ufb01c ex-\namples with di\ufb00erent amounts of supersymmetry3. The action of \u0393 on the S5 is the\nsame as its action on the angular coordinates of R6. If the original action of \u0393 had\nonly the origin as its \ufb01xed point, the space S5/\u0393 is smooth. On the other hand, if the\noriginal action had a space of \ufb01xed points, some \ufb01xed points remain, and the space\nS5/\u0393 includes orbifold singularities. In this case the space is not geometrically smooth,\nand the supergravity approximation is not valid (though of course in string theory it is\na standard orbifold compacti\ufb01cation which is generically not singular). The spectrum\nof string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5/\u0393 includes states from untwisted and twisted sectors of\nthe orbifold. The untwisted states are just the \u0393-projection of the original states of\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5, and they include in particular the \u0393-invariant supergravity states. These\nstates have (in the classical supergravity limit) the same masses as in the original\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5 background [347], corresponding to integer dimensions in the \ufb01eld theory,\nwhich is why we often \ufb01nd in orbifolds operators of dimension 2 or 4 which can desta-\nbilize non-supersymmetric backgrounds. If the orbifold group has \ufb01xed points on the\nS5, there are also light twisted sector states that are localized near these \ufb01xed points,\nwhich need to be added to the supergravity \ufb01elds for a proper description of the low-\nenergy dynamics. On the other hand, if the orbifold has no \ufb01xed points, all twisted\nsector states are heavy,4 since they involve strings stretching between identi\ufb01ed points\non the S5. In this case the twisted sector states decouple from the low-energy theory\nin space-time (for large gsN). There is a global \u0393 symmetry in the corresponding \ufb01eld\ntheory, under which the untwisted sector states are neutral while the twisted sector\nstates are charged.\nIn the \u2019t Hooft limit of N \u2192\u221ewith gsN \ufb01nite, all the solutions of the form\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5/\u0393 have a \ufb01xed line corresponding to the dilaton, indicating that the beta\nfunction of the corresponding \ufb01eld theories vanishes in this limit [330]. In fact, one\ncan prove [348, 349, 350] (see also [351, 352]) that in this limit, which corresponds to\nkeeping only the planar diagrams in the \ufb01eld theory, all the correlation functions of the\nuntwisted sector operators in the orbifold theories are the same (up to multiplication\n3We will not discuss here orbifolds that act non-trivially on the AdS space, as in [346].\n4Note that this happens even when in the original description there were massless twisted sector\nstates localized at the origin.\n114\n\n\nby some power of dim(\u0393)) as in the N = 4 SYM theory corresponding to AdS5 \u00d7 S5 5.\nThis is the analog of the usual string theory statement that at tree-level the interactions\nof untwisted sector states are exactly inherited from those of the original theory before\nthe orbifolding. For example, the central charge of the \ufb01eld theory (appearing in the\n2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor) is (in this limit) just dim(\u0393) times\nthe central charge of the corresponding N = 4 theory. This may easily be seen also\non the string theory side, where the central charge may be shown [173] to be inversely\nproportional to the volume of the compact space (and Vol(S5/\u0393) = Vol(S5)/dim(\u0393)).\nThe vanishing of the beta function in the \u2019t Hooft limit follows from this general\nresult (as predicted by the AdS/CFT correspondence). This applies both to orbifolds\nwhich preserve supersymmetry and to those which do not, and leads to many examples\nof supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories which have \ufb01xed lines in the large\nN limit. At subleading orders in 1/N, the correlation functions di\ufb00er between the\norbifold theory and the N = 4 theory, and in principle a non-zero beta function\nmay arise. In supersymmetric orbifolds supersymmetry prevents this6, but in non-\nsupersymmetric theories generically there will no longer be a \ufb01xed line for \ufb01nite N.\nThe dilaton potential is then related to the appearance of a non-zero beta function in\nthe \ufb01eld theory, and the minima of this potential are related to the zeros of the \ufb01eld\ntheory beta function for \ufb01nite N.\nAs a \ufb01rst example we can analyze the case [330] of D3-branes on an R4/Zk orb-\nifold singularity, which preserves N = 2 supersymmetry.\nBefore taking the near-\nhorizon limit, the low-energy \ufb01eld theory (at the free orbifold point in the string the-\nory moduli space) is a U(N)k gauge theory with bifundamental hypermultiplets in the\n(N, \u00afN, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 1) + (1, N, \u00afN, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1, N, \u00afN) + ( \u00afN, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 1, N) repre-\nsentation. The bare gauge couplings \u03c4i of all the U(N) theories are equal to the string\ncoupling \u03c4IIB at this point in the moduli space. In the near-horizon (low-energy) limit\nthis \ufb01eld theory becomes the SU(N)k \ufb01eld theory with the same matter content, since\nthe o\ufb00-diagonal U(1) factors are IR-free7 (and the diagonal U(1) factor is decoupled\nhere and in all other examples in this section so we will ignore it). This theory is dual\nto type IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5/Zk, where the Zk action leaves \ufb01xed an S1\ninside the S5.\nThis \ufb01eld theory is known (see, for instance, [353]) to be a \ufb01nite \ufb01eld theory for any\nvalue of the k gauge couplings \u03c4i, corresponding to a k-complex-dimensional surface\nof conformal \ufb01eld theories. Thus, we should see k complex parameters in the string\n5There is no similar relation for the twisted sector operators.\n6At least, it prevents a potential for the dilaton, so there is still some \ufb01xed line in the \ufb01eld theory,\nthough it can be shifted from the N = 4 \ufb01xed line when 1/N corrections are taken into account.\n7This does not contradict our previous statements about the beta functions since the U(1) factors\nare subleading in the 1/N expansion, and the operators corresponding to the o\ufb00-diagonal U(1)\u2019s come\nfrom twisted sectors.\n115\n\n\ntheory background which we can change without destroying the AdS5 component of\nthis background. One such parameter is obviously the dilaton, and the other (k \u22121)\nmay be identi\ufb01ed [330] with the values of the NS-NS and R-R 2-form B-\ufb01elds on the\n(k \u22121) 2-cycles which vanish at the Zk orbifold singularity (these are part of the blow-\nup modes for the singularities; the other blow-up modes turn on \ufb01elds which change the\nAdS5 background, and correspond to non-marginal deformations of the \ufb01eld theory).\nThe low-energy spectrum has contributions both from the untwisted and from the\ntwisted sectors. The untwisted sector states are just the Zk projection of the original\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5 states. The twisted sector states are the same (for large N and at low\nenergies) as those which appear in \ufb02at space at an R4/Zk singularity, except that here\nthey live on the \ufb01xed locus of the Zk action which is of the form AdS5 \u00d7 S1. At the\norbifold point the massless twisted sector states are (k \u22121) tensor multiplets (these\ntensor multiplets include scalars corresponding to the 2-form B-\ufb01elds described above).\nUpon dimensional reduction on the S1 these give rise to (k \u22121) U(1) gauge \ufb01elds on\nAdS5, which correspond to the U(1) global symmetries of the \ufb01eld theory (which were\nthe o\ufb00-diagonal gauge U(1)\u2019s before taking the near-horizon limit, and become global\nsymmetries after this limit); see, e.g. [354]. The orbifold point corresponds to having\nall the B-\ufb01elds maximally turned on [355]. The spectrum of \ufb01elds on AdS5 in this\nbackground was successfully compared [356] to the spectrum of chiral operators in the\n\ufb01eld theory. If we move in the string theory moduli space to a point where the B-\n\ufb01elds on some 2-cycles are turned o\ufb00, the D3-branes wrapped around these 2-cycles\nbecome tensionless, and the low-energy theory becomes a non-trivial N = (2, 0) six\ndimensional SCFT (see [93] and references therein).\nThe low-energy spectrum on\nAdS5 then includes the dimensional reduction of this conformal theory on a circle. In\nparticular, when all the B-\ufb01elds are turned o\ufb00, we get the Ak\u22121 (2, 0) theory, which gives\nrise to SU(k) gauge \ufb01elds at low-energies upon compacti\ufb01cation on a circle. Thus, the\nAdS/CFT correspondence predicts an enhanced global SU(k) symmetry at a particular\npoint in the parameter space of the corresponding \ufb01eld theory. Presumably, this point\nis in a very strongly coupled regime (the string coupling \u03c4IIB \u221dP\ni \u03c4i may be chosen\nto be weak, but individual \u03c4i\u2019s can still be strongly coupled) which cannot be accessed\ndirectly in the \ufb01eld theory. The \ufb01eld theory in this case has a large group of duality\nsymmetries [353], which includes (but is not limited to) the SL(2, Z) subgroup which\nacts on the couplings as \u03c4 \u2192(a\u03c4 + b)/(c\u03c4 + d) at the point where they are all equal.\nIn the type IIB background the SL(2, Z) subgroup of this duality group is manifest,\nbut it is not clear how to see the rest of this group.\nOur second example corresponds to D3-branes at an R6/Z3 orbifold point, where, if\nwe write R6 as C3 with complex coordinates zj (j = 1, 2, 3), the Z3 acts as zj \u2192e2\u03c0i/3zj.\nIn this case the only \ufb01xed point of the Z3 action is the origin, so in the near-horizon\nlimit we get [330] AdS5 \u00d7 S5/Z3 where the compact space is smooth. Thus, the low-\n116\n\n\nenergy spectrum in this case (for large gsN) includes only the Z3 projection of the\noriginal supergravity spectrum, and all twisted sector states are heavy in this limit.\nThe corresponding \ufb01eld theory may be derived by the methods of [344, 345]. It is\nan SU(N)3 gauge theory, with chiral multiplets Uj (j = 1, 2, 3) in the (N, \u00afN, 1) repre-\nsentation, Vj (j = 1, 2, 3) in the (1, N, \u00afN) representation, and Wj (j = 1, 2, 3) in the\n( \u00afN, 1, N) representation, and a classical superpotential of the form W = g\u01ebijkUiVjWk.\nIn the classical theory all three gauge couplings and the superpotential coupling g are\nequal (and equal to the string coupling). In the quantum theory one can prove that\nin the space of these four parameters there is a one dimensional line of superconfor-\nmal \ufb01xed points. The parameter which parameterizes this \ufb01xed line (which passes\nthrough weak coupling in the gauge theory) may be identi\ufb01ed with the dilaton in the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5/Z3 background. Unlike the previous case, here there are no indications of\nadditional marginal deformations, and no massless twisted sector states on AdS5 which\nthey could correspond to.\nAs in the previous case, one can try to compare the spectrum of \ufb01elds on AdS5\nwith the spectrum of chiral operators in the \ufb01eld theory. In this case, as in all cases\nwith less than N = 4 supersymmetry, not all the supergravity \ufb01elds on AdS5 are in\nchiral multiplets, since the N = 4 chiral multiplets split into chiral, anti-chiral and\nnon-chiral multiplets when decomposed into N = 2 (or N = 1) representations8 (in\ngeneral there can also be various sizes of chiral multiplets). However, one can still\ncompare those of the \ufb01elds which are in chiral multiplets (and have the appropriate\nrelations between their AdS mass / \ufb01eld theory dimension and their R-charges). The\nuntwisted states may easily be matched since they are a projection of the original\nstates both in space-time and in the \ufb01eld theory (if we think of the \ufb01eld theory as a\nprojection of the N = 4 SU(3N) gauge theory). Looking at the twisted sectors we\nseem to encounter a paradox [333]. On the string theory side all the twisted sector\nstates are heavy (they correspond to strings stretched across the S5, so they would\ncorrespond to operators with \u2206\u2243mR \u2243R2/l2\ns \u2243(gsN)1/2). On the \ufb01eld theory side\nwe can identify the twisted sector \ufb01elds with operators which are charged under the\nglobal Z3 symmetry which rotates the three gauge groups, and naively there exist chiral\noperators which are charged under this symmetry and remain of \ufb01nite dimension in the\nlarge N, g2\nY MN limit. However, a careful analysis shows that all of these operators are\nin fact descendants, so their dimensions are not protected. For example, the operator\nP3\nj=1 e2\u03c0ij/3Tr((W (j)\n\u03b1 )2), where W (j)\n\u03b1\nis the \ufb01eld strength multiplet of the j\u2019th SU(N)\ngroup, seems to be a chiral super\ufb01eld charged under the Z3 symmetry. However, using\nlinear combinations of the Konishi anomaly equations [357, 358] for the three gauge\ngroups, one can show that this operator (and all other \u201ctwisted sector\u201d operators) is in\n8Note that this means that unlike the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 case, in cases with less SUSY there are always\nnon-chiral operators which have a \ufb01nite dimension in the large N, g2\nY MN limit.\n117\n\n\nfact a descendant, so there is no paradox. The AdS/CFT correspondence predicts that\nin the large N, g2\nY MN limit the dimension of all these Z3-charged operators scales as\n(g2\nY MN)1/2, which is larger than the scaling \u2206\u223c(g2\nY MN)1/4 for the non-chiral operators\nin the N = 4 SYM theory in the same limit. It would be interesting to verify this\nbehavior in the \ufb01eld theory. Baryon-like operators also exist in these theories [359],\nwhich are similar to those which will be discussed in section 4.1.3.\nThere are various other supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds which behave simi-\nlarly to the examples we have described in detail here.\nThere are also many non-\nsupersymmetric examples [360, 361] but, as described above, their fate for \ufb01nite N is\nnot clear, and we will not discuss them in detail here.\n4.1.2\nOrientifolds of AdS5 \u00d7 S5\nThe discussion of the near-horizon limits of D3-branes on orientifolds is mostly similar\nto the discussion of orbifolds, except for the absence of twisted sector states (which do\nnot exist for orientifolds). We will focus here on two examples which illustrate some\nof the general properties of these backgrounds. Additional examples were discussed in\n[362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369].\nOur \ufb01rst example is the near-horizon limit of D3-branes on an orientifold 3-plane.\nThe orientifold breaks the same supersymmetries as the 3-branes do, so in the near\nhorizon limit we have the full 32 supercharges corresponding to a d = 4, N = 4 SCFT.\nIn \ufb02at space there are (see [370] and references therein) two types of orientifold planes\nwhich lead to di\ufb00erent projections on D-brane states. One type of orientifold plane\nleads to a low-energy SO(2N) N = 4 gauge theory for N D-branes on the orientifold,\nwhile the other leads to a USp(2N) N = 4 gauge theory. In the \ufb01rst case we can also\nhave an additional \u201chalf D3-brane\u201d stuck on the orientifold, leading to an SO(2N + 1)\nN = 4 gauge theory. In the near-horizon limits of branes on the orientifold we should\nbe able to \ufb01nd string theory backgrounds which are dual to all of these gauge theories.\nThe near-horizon limit of these brane con\ufb01gurations is type IIB string theory on\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5/Z2 \u2261AdS5 \u00d7 RP5, where the Z2 acts by identifying opposite points on\nthe S5, so there are no \ufb01xed points and the space RP5 is smooth. The manifestation\nof the orientifolding in the near-horizon limit is that when a string goes around a\nnon-contractible cycle in RP5 (connecting opposite points of the S5) its orientation\nis reversed. In all the cases discussed above the string theory perturbation expansion\nhad only closed orientable surfaces, so it was a power series in g2\ns (or in 1/N2 in the\n\u2019t Hooft limit); but in this background we can also have non-orientable closed surfaces\nwhich include crosscaps, and the perturbation expansion includes also odd powers of\ngs (or of 1/N in the \u2019t Hooft limit). In fact, it has long been known [37] that in the\n\u2019t Hooft limit the SO(N) and USp(N) gauge theories give rise to Feynman diagrams\n118\n\n\nthat involve also non-orientable surfaces (as opposed to the SU(N) case which gives\nonly orientable surfaces), so it is not surprising that such diagrams arise in the string\ntheory which is dual to these theories. While in the cases described above the leading\ncorrection in string perturbation theory was of order g2\ns (or 1/N2 in the \u2019t Hooft limit),\nin the AdS5 \u00d7RP5 background (and in general in orientifold backgrounds) the leading\ncorrection comes from RP2 worldsheets and is of order gs (or 1/N in the \u2019t Hooft limit).\nSuch a correction appears, for instance, in the computation of the central charge (the 2-\npoint function of the energy-momentum tensor) of these theories, which is proportional\nto the dimension of the corresponding gauge group.\nOur discussion so far has not distinguished between the di\ufb00erent con\ufb01gurations cor-\nresponding to SO(2N), SO(2N +1) and USp(2N) groups (the only obvious parameter\nin the orientifold background is the 5-form \ufb02ux N). In the Feynman diagram expansion\nit is well-known [371, 372] that the SO(2N) and USp(2N) theories are related by a\ntransformation taking N to (\u2212N), which inverts the sign of all diagrams with an odd\nnumber of crosscaps in the \u2019t Hooft limit. Thus, we should look for a similar e\ufb00ect in\nstring theory on AdS5\u00d7RP5. It turns out [216] that this is implemented by a \u201cdiscrete\ntorsion\u201d on RP5, corresponding to turning on a BNS\u2212NS 2-form in the non-trivial co-\nhomology class of H3(RP5, \u02dcZ) = Z2. The e\ufb00ect of turning on this \u201cdiscrete torsion\u201d is\nexactly to invert the sign of all string diagrams with an odd number of crosscaps. It is\nalso possible to turn on a similar \u201cdiscrete torsion\u201d for the RR 2-form B-\ufb01eld, so there\nis a total of four di\ufb00erent possible string theories on AdS5 \u00d7 RP5. It turns out that\nthe theory with no B-\ufb01elds is equivalent to the SO(2N) N = 4 gauge theory, which\nis self-dual under the S-duality group SL(2, Z). The theory with only a non-zero BRR\n\ufb01eld is equivalent to the SO(2N + 1) gauge theory, while the theories with non-zero\nBNS\u2212NS \ufb01elds are equivalent to the USp(2N) gauge theory [216], and this is consistent\nwith the action of S-duality on these groups and on the 2-form B-\ufb01elds (which are a\ndoublet of SL(2, Z)).\nAn interesting test of this correspondence is the matching of chiral primary \ufb01elds.\nIn the supergravity limit the \ufb01elds on AdS5 \u00d7 RP5 are just the Z2 projection of the\n\ufb01elds on AdS5 \u00d7 S5, including the multiplets with n = 2, 4, 6, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (in the notation of\nsection 3.2). This matches with almost all the chiral super\ufb01elds in the corresponding\ngauge theories, which are described as traces of products of the fundamental \ufb01elds as\nin section 3.2, but with the trace of a product of an odd number of \ufb01elds vanishing in\nthese theories from symmetry arguments. However, in the SO(2N) gauge theories (and\nnot in any of the others) there is an additional gauge invariant chiral super\ufb01eld, called\nthe Pfa\ufb03an, whose lowest component is of the form \u01eba1a2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a2N\u03c6I1\na1a2\u03c6I2\na3a4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6IN\na2N\u22121a2N,\nwhere ai are SO(2N) indices and the Ij are (symmetric traceless) indices in the 6 of\nSU(4)R. The supersymmetry algebra guarantees that the dimension of this operator\nis \u2206= N, and it is independent of the other gauge-invariant chiral super\ufb01elds. This\n119\n\n\noperator may be identi\ufb01ed with the \ufb01eld on AdS5 corresponding to a D3-brane wrapped\naround a 3-cycle in RP5, corresponding to the homology class H3(RP5, Z) = Z2. This\nwrapping is only possible when no B-\ufb01elds are turned on [216], consistent with such\nan operator existing for SO(2N) but not for SO(2N + 1) or USp(2N). While it is\nnot known how to compute the mass of this state directly, the superconformal algebra\nguarantees that it has the right mass to correspond to an operator with \u2206= N; the\nnaive approximation to the mass, since the volume of the 3-cycle in RP5 is \u03c02R3, is\nmR \u2243R \u00b7 \u03c02R3/(2\u03c0)3gsl4\ns = R4/8\u03c0l4\np \u2243N (since in the orientifold case R4 \u22434\u03c0(2N)l4\np\ninstead of equation (3.3)), which leads to the correct dimension for large N.\nThe\nexistence of this operator (which decouples in the large N limit) is an important test\nof the \ufb01nite N correspondence. Anomaly matching in this background was discussed\nin [233].\nAnother interesting background is the near-horizon limit of D3-branes on an orien-\ntifold 7-plane, with 4 D7-branes coincident on the orientifold plane to ensure [373, 374]\nthat the dilaton is constant and the low-energy theory is conformal (this is the same\nas D3-branes in F-theory [375] at a D4-type singularity). The \ufb01eld theory we get in\nthe near-horizon limit in this case is [376, 377] an N = 2 SQCD theory with USp(2N)\ngauge group, a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation and four hyper-\nmultiplets in the fundamental representation. In this case the orientifold action has\n\ufb01xed points on the S5, so the near-horizon limit is [378, 379] type IIB string theory\non AdS5 \u00d7 S5/Z2 where the Z2 action has \ufb01xed points on an S3 inside the S5. Thus,\nthis background includes an orientifold plane with the topology of S3 \u00d7 AdS5, and the\nD7-branes stretched along the orientifold plane also remain as part of the background,\nso that the low-energy theory includes both the supergravity modes in the bulk and the\nSO(8) gauge theory on the D7-branes (which corresponds to an SO(8) global symme-\ntry in the corresponding \ufb01eld theories)9. The string perturbation expansion in this case\nhas two sources of corrections of order gs, the crosscap diagram and the open string\ndisc diagram with strings ending on the D7-brane, leading to two types of corrections\nof order 1/N in the \u2019t Hooft limit. Again, the spectrum of operators in the \ufb01eld theory\nmay be matched [379] with the spectrum of \ufb01elds coming from the dimensional reduc-\ntion of the supergravity theory in the bulk and of the 7-brane theory wrapped on the\nS3. The anomalies may also be matched to the \ufb01eld theory, including 1/N corrections\nto the leading large N result [232] which arise from disc and crosscap diagrams.\nBy studying other backgrounds of D3-branes with 7-branes (with or without ori-\nentifolds) one can obtain non-conformal theories which exhibit a logarithmic running\nof the coupling constant [379, 380]. For instance, by separating the D7-branes away\nfrom the orientifold plane, corresponding to giving a mass to the hypermultiplets in\nthe fundamental representation, one \ufb01nds string theory solutions in which the dilaton\n9Similar backgrounds were discussed in [172].\n120\n\n\nvaries in a similar way to the variation of the coupling constant in the \ufb01eld theory,\nand this behavior persists also in the near-horizon limit (which is quite complicated in\nthis case, and becomes singular close to the branes, corresponding to the low-energy\nlimit of the \ufb01eld theories which is in this case a free Abelian Coulomb phase). This\nagreement with the perturbative expectation, even though we are (necessarily) in a\nregime of large \u03bb = g2\nY MN, is due to special properties of N = 2 gauge theories, which\nprevent many quantities from being renormalized beyond one-loop.\n4.1.3\nConifold theories\nIn the correspondence between string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 and d = 4 N = 4 SYM\ntheories, some of the most direct checks, such as protected operator dimensions and the\nfunctional form of two- and three-point functions, are determined by properties of the\nsupergroup SU(2, 2|4). Many of the normalizations of two- and three-point functions\nwhich have been computed explicitly are protected by non-renormalization theorems.\nAnd yet, we are inclined to believe that the correspondence is a fundamental dynam-\nical principle, valid independent of group theory and the special non-renormalization\nproperties of N = 4 supersymmetry.\nTo test this belief we want to consider theories with reduced supersymmetry. Orb-\nifold theories [330] provide interesting examples; however, as discussed in the previous\nsections, it has been shown [349, 350] that at large N these theories are a projection\nof N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory; in particular many of their Green\u2019s functions are\ndictated by the Green\u2019s functions of the N = 4 theory. The projection involved is\nonto states invariant under the group action that de\ufb01nes the orbifold. Intuitively, this\nsimilarity with the N = 4 theory arises because the compact part of the geometry is\nstill (almost everywhere) locally S5, just with some global identi\ufb01cations. Therefore,\nto make a more non-trivial test of models with reduced supersymmetry, we are more\ninterested in geometries of the form AdS5 \u00d7 M5 where the compact manifold M5 is not\neven locally S5.\nIn fact, such compacti\ufb01cations have a long history in the supergravity literature: the\ndirect product geometry AdS5 \u00d7 M5 is known as the Freund-Rubin ansatz [113]. The\ncurvature of the anti-de Sitter part of the geometry is supported by the \ufb01ve-form of\ntype IIB supergravity. Because this \ufb01ve-form is self-dual, M5 must also be an Einstein\nmanifold, but with positive cosmological constant: rescaling M5 if necessary, we can\nwrite R\u03b1\u03b2 = 4g\u03b1\u03b2. For simplicity, we are assuming that only the \ufb01ve-form and the\nmetric are involved in the solution.\nA trivial but useful observation is that \ufb01ve-dimensional Einstein manifolds with\nR\u03b1\u03b2 = 4g\u03b1\u03b2 are in one-to-one correspondence with Ricci-\ufb02at manifolds C6 whose metric\n121\n\n\nhas the conical form\nds2\nC6 = dr2 + r2ds2\nM5 .\n(4.1)\nIt can be shown that, given any metric of the form (4.1), the ten-dimensional metric\nds2\n10 =\n \n1 + R4\nr4\n!\u22121/2 \u0010\n\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2 + dx2\n3\n\u0011\n+\n \n1 + R4\nr4\n!1/2\nds2\nC6\n(4.2)\nis a solution of the type IIB supergravity equations, provided one puts N units of\n\ufb01ve-form \ufb02ux through the manifold M5, where\nR4 =\n\u221a\u03c0\n2\n\u03baN\nVol M5\n.\n(4.3)\nFurthermore, it was shown in [172] that the number of supersymmetries preserved by\nthe geometry (4.2) is half the number that are preserved by its Ricci-\ufb02at R \u21920 limit.\nPreservation of supersymmetry therefore amounts to the existence of a Killing spinor\non ds2\nC6, which would imply that it is a Calabi-Yau metric. Finally, the r \u226aR limit of\n(4.2) is precisely AdS5\u00d7M5, and in that limit the number of preserved supersymmetries\ndoubles.\nThese facts suggest a useful means of searching for non-trivial Freund-Rubin geome-\ntries: starting with a string vacuum of the form R3,1 \u00d7 C6, where C6 is Ricci-\ufb02at, we\nlocate a singularity of C6 where the metric locally has the form (4.1), and place a large\nnumber of D3-branes at that point. The resulting near-horizon Freund-Rubin geome-\ntry has the same number of supersymmetries as the original braneless string geometry.\nThe program of searching for and classifying such singularities on manifolds preserving\nsome supersymmetry was enunciated most completely in [333].\nWe will focus our attention on the simplest non-trivial example, which was worked\nout in [217]10. C6 is taken to be the standard conifold, which as a complex 3-fold is\ndetermined by the equation\nz2\n1 + z2\n2 + z2\n3 + z2\n4 = 0 .\n(4.4)\nThe Calabi-Yau metric on this manifold has SU(3) holonomy, so one quarter of super-\nsymmetry is preserved. We will always count our supersymmetries in four-dimensional\nsuperconformal \ufb01eld theory terms, so one quarter of maximal supersymmetry (that is,\neight real supercharges) is in our terminology N = 1 supersymmetry (superconformal\nsymmetry). The supergravity literature often refers to this amount of supersymmetry\nin \ufb01ve dimensions as N = 2, because in a \ufb02at space supergravity theory with this\n10Additional aspects and examples of conifold theories were discussed in [381, 382, 383, 384, 385,\n386].\n122\n\n\nmuch supersymmetry, reduction on S1 without breaking any supersymmetry leads to\na supergravity theory in four dimensions with N = 2 supersymmetry.\nThe Calabi-Yau metric on the manifold (4.4) may be derived from the K\u00a8ahler po-\ntential K =\n\u0010P4\ni=1 |zi|2\u00112/3, and can be explicitly written as\nds2\nC6 = dr2 + r2ds2\nT 11,\n(4.5)\nwhere ds2\nT 11 is the Einstein metric on the coset space\nT 11 = SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\nU(1)\n.\n(4.6)\nIn the quotient (4.6), the U(1) generator is chosen to be the sum 1\n2\u03c33+ 1\n2\u03c43 of generators\nof the two SU(2)\u2019s.\nThe manifolds T pq, where the U(1) generator is chosen to be\np\n2\u03c33 + q\n2\u03c43, with p and q relatively prime, were studied in [174]. The topology of each of\nthese manifolds is S2 \u00d7 S3. They all admit unique Einstein metrics. Only T 11 leads to\na six-manifold C6 which admits Killing spinors. In fact, besides S5 = SO(6)/SO(5),\nT 11 is the unique \ufb01ve-dimensional coset space which preserves supersymmetry. The\nEinstein metrics can be obtained via a rescaling of the Killing metric on SU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\nby a process explained in [174]. The metric on T 11 satisfying R\u03b1\u03b2 = 4g\u03b1\u03b2 can be written\nas\nds2\nT 11 = 1\n6\n2\nX\ni=1\n\u0010\nd\u03b82\ni + sin2 \u03b8id\u03c62\ni\n\u0011\n+ 1\n9 (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82d\u03c62)2 .\n(4.7)\nThe volume of this metric is 16\u03c03/27, whereas the volume of the unit \ufb01ve-sphere, which\nalso has R\u03b1\u03b2 = 4g\u03b1\u03b2, is \u03c03.\nPerhaps the most intuitive way to motivate the conjectured dual gauge theory [217]\nis to \ufb01rst consider the S5/Z2 orbifold gauge theory, where the Z2 is chosen to \ufb02ip the\nsigns of four of the six real coordinates in R6, and thus has a \ufb01xed S1 on the unit S5\nin this \ufb02at space. This Z2 breaks SO(6) down to SO(4) \u00d7 SO(2), which is the same\nisometry group as for T 11. In fact, it can also be shown that an appropriate blowup of\nthe singularities along the \ufb01xed S1 leads to a manifold of topology S2 \u00d7 S3. Since T 11\nis a smooth deformation of the blown-up orbifold, one might suspect that its dual \ufb01eld\ntheory is some deformation of the orbifold\u2019s dual \ufb01eld theory.

The\nexistence of a non-trivial infrared \ufb01xed point can be demonstrated using the methods\nof [387]: having integrated out the heavy \ufb01elds \u03a6 and \u02dc\u03a6, the superpotential is quartic\nin the remaining \ufb01elds, which should, therefore, all have dimension 3/4 at the infrared\n\ufb01xed point (assuming that we do not break the symmetry between the two gauge\ngroups). The anomalous dimension \u03b3 = \u22121/2 for the quadratic operators TrAB is\nprecisely what is needed to make the exact beta functions vanish.\nThe IR \ufb01xed point of the renormalization group described in the previous paragraph\nis the candidate for the \ufb01eld theory dual to type IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7T 11, or in\nweak coupling terms the low-energy \ufb01eld theory of coincident D3-branes on a conifold\nsingularity.\nThere are several non-trivial checks that this is the right theory.\nThe\nsimplest is to note that the moduli space of the N = 1 version of the theory is simply\nthe conifold. For N = 1 the scalar \ufb01elds ai and bj (in the chiral multiplets Ai and Bj)\nare just complex-valued. The moduli space can be parametrized by the combinations\naibj, and if we write\n\u0012 z1 + iz4\niz2 + z3\niz2 \u2212z3\nz1 \u2212iz4\n\u0013\n=\n\u0012 a1b1\na1b2\na2b1\na2b2\n\u0013\n,\n(4.11)\nthen we recover the conifold equation (4.4) by taking the determinant of both sides.\nIn the N > 1 theories, a slight generalization of this line of argument leads to the\nconclusion that the fully Higgsed phase of the theory, where all the D3-branes are\nseparated from one another, has for its moduli space the Nth symmetric power of the\nconifold.\nThe most notable prediction of the renormalization group analysis of the gauge\ntheory is that the operators TrAiBj should have dimension 3/2. This is something we\nshould be able to see from the dual description. As a warmup, consider \ufb01rst the N = 4\nexample. There, as described in section 3.2, the lowest dimension operators have the\nform Tr\u03c6(I\u03c6J), and their dimension is two. Their description in supergravity is a Weyl\ndeformation of the S5 part of the geometry with ha\na \u221dY 2(y), where ha\na is the trace\nof the metric on S5 and Y 2(y) is a d-wave spherical harmonic on S5. The four-form\n124\n\n\npotential Dabcd is also involved in the deformation, and there are two mass eigenstates\nin AdS5 which are combinations of these two \ufb01elds. A simple way to compute Y 2 is to\nstart with the function xixj on R6 and restrict it to the unit S5. This suggests quite\na general way to \ufb01nd eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on an Einstein manifold M5: we\nstart by looking for harmonic functions on the associated conical geometry (4.1). The\nLaplacian is\nC6 = 1\nr5\u2202rr5\u2202r + 1\nr2\nM5 .\n(4.12)\nThe operator r2\nC6 commutes with r\u2202r, so we can restrict our search to functions f\non C6 with\nC6 f = 0 and r\u2202rf = \u2206f for some constant \u2206. Such harmonic functions\nrestricted to r = 1 have\nM5 f\n\f\f\f\nr=1 = \u2212\u2206(\u2206+ 4)f\n\f\f\f\nr=1. Following through the analysis\nof [126] one learns that the mass of the lighter of the two scalars in AdS5 corresponding\nto ha\na \u221df\n\f\f\fr=1 is m2R2 = \u2206(\u2206\u22124). So, the dimension of the corresponding operator is\n\u2206. In view of (4.11), all we need to do to verify in the supergravity approximation the\nrenormalization group prediction \u2206= 3/2 for TrAiBj is to show that r\u2202rzi = 3\n2zi. This\nfollows from scaling considerations as follows. The dilation symmetry on the cone is\nr \u2192\u03bbr. Under this dilation, ds2\nC6 \u2192\u03bb2ds2\nC6. The K\u00a8ahler form should have this same\nscaling, and that will follow if also the K\u00a8ahler potential K \u2192\u03bb2K. As mentioned\nabove, the Calabi-Yau metric follows from K =\n\u0010P4\ni=1 |zi|2\u00112/3, which has the desired\nscaling if zi \u2192\u03bb3/2zi. Thus, indeed r\u2202rzi = 3\n2zi.\nIt is straightforward to generalize the above line of argument to operators of the\nform TrA(i1B(j1 . . . Ai\u2113)Bj\u2113). Various aspects of the matching of operators in the con-\nformal \ufb01eld theory to Kaluza-Klein modes in supergravity have been studied in [217,\n173, 388]. But there is another interesting type of color singlet operators, which are\ncalled dibaryons because the color indices of each gauge group are combined using an\nantisymmetric tensor. The dibaryon operator is\n\u01eb\u03b11...\u03b1N\u01eb\u03b21...\u03b2NA\u03b11\u03b21 . . . A\u03b1N \u03b2N ,\n(4.13)\nwhere we have suppressed SU(2) indices. Let us use the notation SU(2)A for the global\nsymmetry group under which Ai form a doublet, and SU(2)B for the group under which\nBj form a doublet. Clearly, (4.13) is a singlet under SU(2)B. This provides the clue\nto its string theory dual, which must also be SU(2)B-symmetric: it is a D3-brane\nwrapped on T 11 along an orbit of SU(2)B [218]. Using the explicit metric (4.7), it\nis straightforward to verify that mR = 3\n4N in the test brane approximation. Up to\ncorrections of order 1/N, the mass-dimension relation is \u2206= mR, so we see that\nagain the \ufb01eld theory prediction for the anomalous dimension of A is born out. The 3-\ncycle which the D3-brane is wrapped on may be shown to be the unique homologically\nnon-trivial 3-cycle of T 11. There is also an anti-dibaryon, schematically BN, which\nis a D3-brane wrapped on an orbit of SU(2)A. The two wrappings are opposite in\n125\n\n\nhomology, so the dibaryon and anti-dibaryon can annihilate to produce mesons. This\ninteresting process has never been studied in any detail, no doubt because the dynamics\nis complicated and non-supersymmetric. It is possible to construct dibaryon operators\nalso in a variety of orbifold theories [218, 359].\nThe gauge theory dual to T 11 descends via renormalization group \ufb02ow from the\ngauge theory dual to S5/Z2, as described after (4.10). The conformal anomaly has\nbeen studied extensively for such \ufb02ows (see for example [225]), and the coe\ufb03cient a in\n(3.31) is smaller in the IR than in the UV for every known \ufb02ow that connects UV and\nIR \ufb01xed points. Cardy has conjectured that this must always be the case [389]. To\ndescribe the \ufb01eld theoretic attempts to prove such a c-theorem would take us too far\na\ufb01eld, so instead we refer the reader to [390] and references therein. In section 4.3.2\nwe will demonstrate that a limited c-theorem follows from elementary properties of\ngravity if the AdS/CFT correspondence is assumed.\nIn the presence of N = 1 superconformal invariance, one can compute the anomaly\ncoe\ufb03cients a and c in (3.31) if one knows \u27e8\u2202\u00b5R\u00b5\u27e9g\u00b5\u03bd,B\u03bb, where R\u00b5 is the R-current\nwhich participates in the superconformal algebra, and the expectation value is taken\nin the presence of an arbitrary metric g\u00b5\u03bd and an external gauge \ufb01eld source B\u00b5 for\nthe R-current. The reason a and c can be extracted from this anomalous one-point\nfunction is that \u2202\u00b5R\u00b5 and T \u00b5\n\u00b5 are superpartners in the N = 1 multiplet of anomalies.\nIt was shown in [225] via a supergroup argument that\n\u27e8(\u2202\u00b5R\u00b5)T\u03b1\u03b2T\u03b3\u03b4\u27e9= (a \u2212c)[ ]\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\u27e8(\u2202\u00b5R\u00b5)R\u03b1R\u03b2\u27e9= (5a \u22123c)[ ]\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(4.14)\nwhere now the correlators are computed in \ufb02at space. The omitted expressions between\nthe square brackets are tensors depending on the positions or momenta of the operators\nin the correlator. Their form is not of interest to us here because it is the same for any\ntheory: we are interested instead in the coe\ufb03cients. These can be computed perturba-\ntively via the triangle diagrams in \ufb01gure 4.1. The Adler-Bardeen theorem guarantees\nthat the one loop result is exact, provided \u2202\u00b5R\u00b5 is non-anomalous in the absence of\nexternal sources (that is, it su\ufb00ers from no internal anomalies). The constants of pro-\nportionality in the relations shown in \ufb01gure 4.1 can be tracked down by comparing the\ncomplete Feynman diagram amplitude with the explicit tensor forms which we have\nomitted from (4.14). We are mainly interested in ratios of central charges between IR\nand UV \ufb01xed points, so we do not need to go through this exercise.\nThe \ufb01eld theory dual to S5/Z2, expressed in N = 1 language, has the \ufb01eld con-\ntent described in (4.8). The R-current of the chosen N = 1 superconformal algebra\ndescends from a U(1) in the SO(6) R-symmetry group of the N = 4 algebra, and it\nassigns a U(1)R charge r(\u03bb) = 1 to the 2N2 gauginos (fermionic components of the\nvector super\ufb01eld) and r(\u03c7) = \u22121/3 to the 6N2 \u201cquarks\u201d (fermionic components of the\n126\n\n\n\u03c8\nT\nT\nR\n\u03c8\nR\nR\nR\na)\nb)\na \u2212c \u221d\nX\n\u03c8\nr(\u03c8)\n5a \u22123c \u221d\nX\n\u03c8\nr(\u03c8)3\nFigure 4.1: Triangle diagrams for computing the anomalous contribution to \u2202\u00b5R\u00b5.

We have\nP\n\u03c8 r(\u03c8) = 0, which means that the R-current has no\ngravitational anomalies [391].\nFor the \ufb01eld theory dual to T 11, the R-current described in the previous paragraph is\nno longer non-anomalous because we have added a mass to the adjoint chiral super\ufb01elds.\nThere is, however, a non-anomalous combination S\u00b5 of this current, R\u00b5, with the\nKonishi currents, Ki\n\u00b5, which by de\ufb01nition assign charge 1 to the fermionic \ufb01elds in the\nith chiral multiplet and charge 0 to the fermionic \ufb01elds in the vector multiplets:\nS\u00b5 = R\u00b5 + 2\n3\nX\ni\n\u0010\n\u03b3i\nIR \u2212\u03b3i\u0011\nKi\n\u00b5 .\n(4.15)\nHere \u03b3i is the anomalous dimension of the ith chiral super\ufb01eld. At the strongly in-\nteracting N = 1 infrared \ufb01xed point, S\u00b5 is the current which participates in the\nsuperconformal algebra. However, to compute correlators \u27e8(\u2202\u00b5S\u00b5) . . .\u27e9it is more con-\nvenient to go to the ultraviolet, where \u03b3i = 0 and the perturbative analysis in terms\nof fermions running around a loop can be applied straightforwardly. Using the fact\nthat \u03b3A\nIR = \u03b3B\nIR = \u22121/4 and \u03b3\u03a6\nIR = \u03b3 \u02dc\u03a6\nIR = 1/2, we \ufb01nd that sUV(\u03bb) = 1 for the gaugi-\nnos, sUV(\u03c7) = \u22121/2 for the quarks which stay light (i.e., the bifundamental quarks),\nand sUV(\u03b7) = 0 for the quarks which are made heavy (that is, the adjoint quarks).\nNote that it is immaterial whether we include these heavy quarks in the triangle dia-\ngram, which is as it should be since we can integrate them out explicitly. As before,\n11We will ignore here the distinction between U(N) and SU(N) groups which is subleading in the\n1/N expansion.\n127\n\n\nP\n\u03c8 sUV(\u03c8) = 0, so there are no gravitational anomalies and aIR = cIR. Combining the\ninformation in the past two paragraphs, we have a \ufb01eld theory prediction for the \ufb02ow\nfrom the S5/Z2 theory to the T 11 theory:\naIR\naUV\n= cIR\ncUV\n= 5aIR \u22123cIR\n5aUV \u22123cUV\n=\n2N2 + 4N2 \u0010\n\u22121\n2\n\u00113\n2N2 + 6N2\n\u0010\n\u22121\n3\n\u00113 = 27\n32 .\n(4.16)\nThis analysis was carried out in [173], where it was also noted that these numbers\ncan be computed in the supergravity approximation.\nTo proceed, let us write the\nten-dimensional Einstein metric as\nds2\n10 = R2c\nds\n2\n5 + R2ds2\nM5,\n(4.17)\nwhere R is given by (4.3) and c\nds\n2\n5 is the metric of AdS5 scaled so that \u02c6R\u00b5\u03bd = \u22124\u02c6g\u00b5\u03bd.\nWe will refer to c\nds\n2\n5 as the dimensionless AdS5 metric. Reducing the action from ten\ndimensions to \ufb01ve results in\nS = \u03c03R8\n2\u03ba2\nZ\nd5x\nq\n\u02c6g\n\u0010 \u02c6R + 12 + . . .\n\u0011\n=\n\u03c02N2\n8 Vol M5\nZ\nd5x\nq\n\u02c6g\n\u0010 \u02c6R + 12 + . . .\n\u0011\n,\n(4.18)\nwhere \u221a\u02c6g and \u02c6R under the integral sign refer to the dimensionless AdS5 metric, and\nin the second equality we have used (4.3). In (4.18), \u03ba is the ten-dimensional gravi-\ntational coupling. In computing Green\u2019s functions using the prescription of [19, 20],\nthe prefactor\n\u03c02N2\n8 Vol M5 multiplies every Green\u2019s function. In particular, it becomes the\nnormalization factor for the one-point function \u27e8T \u00b5\n\u00b5 \u27e9as calculated in [226]. Also, as\npointed out in section 3.2, the supergravity calculation in [226] always leads to a = c.\nWithout further thought we can write a = c \u221d(Vol M5)\u22121, and\naIR\naUV\n= cIR\ncUV\n=\n Vol T 11\nVol S5/Z2\n!\u22121\n= 27\n32 ,\n(4.19)\nin agreement with (4.16). It is essential that the volumes in (4.19) be computed for\nmanifolds with the same cosmological constant.\nOur convention has been to have\nR\u03b1\u03b2 = 4g\u03b1\u03b2.\nIt is possible to do better and pin down the exact normalization of the central\ncharges. In fact, literally the \ufb01rst normalization check performed in the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence was the veri\ufb01cation [19] that in the compacti\ufb01cation dual to N = 4\nSU(N) Yang-Mills theory, the coe\ufb03cient c had the value N2/4 (to leading order in\nlarge N). Thus, in general\na = c =\n\u03c03N2\n4 Vol M5\n(4.20)\n128\n\n\n(again to leading order in large N) for the CFT dual to a Freund-Rubin geometry\nAdS5 \u00d7 M5 supported by N units of \ufb01ve-form \ufb02ux through the M5.\nThis is in a\nnormalization convention where the CFT comprised of a single free real scalar \ufb01eld\nhas c = 1/120. See, for example, [173] for a table of standard anomaly coe\ufb03cients per\ndegree of freedom. Even more generally, we can consider any compacti\ufb01cation of string\ntheory or M-theory (or any other, as-yet-unknown theory of quantum gravity) whose\nnon-compact portion is AdS5. This would include in particular type IIB supergravity\ngeometries which involve the BNS,RR\n\u00b5\u03bd\n\ufb01elds, or the complex coupling \u03c4. Say the AdS5\ngeometry has R\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212\u039bg\u00b5\u03bd. If we rescale the metric by a factor of 4/\u039b, we obtain the\ndimensionless AdS5 metric c\nds\n2\n5 with \u02c6R\u00b5\u03bd = \u22124\u02c6g\u00b5\u03bd. In de\ufb01ning a conformal \ufb01eld theory\nthrough its duality to the AdS5 compacti\ufb01cation under consideration, the part of the\naction relevant to the computation of central charges is still the Einstein-Hilbert term\nplus the cosmological term:\nS =\n1\n2\u03ba2\n5\nZ\nd5x \u221ag (R + 3\u039b + . . .) =\n4\n\u03ba2\n5\u039b3/2\nZ\nd5x\nq\n\u02c6g\n\u0010 \u02c6R + 12 + . . .\n\u0011\n,\n(4.21)\nwhere \u03ba2\n5 = 8\u03c0G5 is the \ufb01ve-dimensional gravitational coupling. Comparing straight-\nforwardly with the special case analyzed in (4.20), we \ufb01nd that the conformal anomaly\ncoe\ufb03cients, as always to leading order in 1/N, must be given by\na = c =\n1\nG5\u039b3/2 .\n(4.22)\n4.2\nD-Branes in AdS, Baryons and Instantons\nA conservative form of the AdS/CFT correspondence would be to say that classical\nsupergravity captures the large N asymptotics of some quantities in \ufb01eld theory which\nare algebraically protected against dependence on the \u2019t Hooft coupling. The stronger\nform which is usually advocated, and which we believe is true, is that the \ufb01eld theory\nis literally equivalent to the string theory, and the only issue is understanding the\nmapping from one to the other. To put this belief to the test, it is natural to ask\nwhat in \ufb01eld theory corresponds to non-perturbative objects, such as D-branes, in\nstring theory.\nThe answer was found in [216] for several types of wrapped branes\n(see also [293] for an independent analysis of some cases), and subsequent papers\n[392, 393, 394, 184, 395, 396, 333, 397, 359, 398, 399] have extended and elaborated\non the story. See also [400, 401] for actions for D-branes in anti-de Sitter space, and\n[402, 403] for other related topics. The connection between D-instantons and gauge\ntheory instantons has also been extensively studied, and we summarize the results at\nthe end of this section.\n129\n\n\nLet us start with wrapped branes which have no spatial extent in AdS5: they are\nparticles propagating in this space. The \ufb01eld theory interpretation must be in terms\nof some vertex or operator, as for any other particle in AdS (as described above in the\ncase of supergravity particles). If the compact manifold is S5, then the only topologi-\ncally stable possibility is a wrapped 5-brane. The key observation here is that charge\nconservation requires that N strings must run into or out of the 5-brane. In the case of\na D5-brane, these N strings are fundamental strings (one could also consider SL(2, Z)\nimages of this con\ufb01guration). The argument is a slight variant of the ones used in the\ndiscussion of anomalous brane creation [404, 405, 406]. There are N units of \ufb01ve-form\n(F5) \ufb02ux on the S5, and the coupling\n1\n2\u03c0a\u2227F5 in the D5-brane world-volume translates\nthis \ufb02ux into N units of charge under the U(1) gauge \ufb01eld a on the D5-brane. Since\nthe D5-brane spatial world-volume is closed, the total charge must be zero. A string\nrunning out of the D5-brane counts as (\u22121) unit of U(1) charge, hence the conclusion.\nReversing the orientation of the D5-brane changes the sign of the charge induced by\nF5, and correspondingly the N strings should run into the brane rather than out.\nIn the absence of other D-branes, the strings cannot end anywhere in AdS5, so they\nmust run out to the boundary. A string ending on the boundary is interpreted (see sec-\ntion 3.5) as an electric charge in the fundamental representation of the SU(N) gauge\ngroup: an external (non-dynamical) quark. This interpretation comes from viewing\nthe strings as running from the D5-brane to a D3-brane at in\ufb01nity. It was shown in\n[405] that such stretched strings have a unique ground state which is fermionic, and\nthe conclusion is that the D5-brane \u201cbaryon\u201d is precisely an antisymmetric combina-\ntion of N fermionic fundamental string \u201cquarks.\u201d The gauge theory interpretation is\nclear: because the gauge group is SU(N) rather than U(N), there is a gauge-invariant\nbaryonic vertex for N external fundamental quarks. We will return to a discussion of\nbaryonic objects in section 6.2.2.\nTo obtain other types of wrapped brane objects with no spatial extent in AdS5, we\nmust turn to compact manifolds with more nontrivial homology cycles. Apart from the\nintrinsic interest of studying such objects and the gauge theories in which they occur,\nthe idea is to verify the claim that every object we can exhibit in gauge theory has a\nstringy counterpart, and vice versa.\nFollowing [216] and the discussion in section 4.1.2, we now examine wrapped branes\nin the AdS5 \u00d7 RP5 geometry, which is the near-horizon geometry of D3-branes placed\non top of a Z2 orientifold three-plane (the Z2 acts as xi \u2192\u2212xi for the six coordinates\nperpendicular to the D3-branes). H3(RP5, Z) = Z2, and the generator of the homology\ngroup is a projective space RP3 \u2282RP5. This seems to o\ufb00er the possibility of wrapping\na D3-brane on a 3-cycle to get a particle in AdS5. However, there is a caveat: as argued\nin [216] the wrapping is permitted only if there is no discrete torsion for the NS and\nRR B-\ufb01elds. In gauge theory terms, that amounts to saying that the corresponding\n130\n\n\noperator is permitted if and only if the gauge group is SO(N) with N even. Direct\ncalculation leads to a mass m \u2243N/R for the wrapped brane, so the corresponding\ngauge theory operator has dimension N (at least to leading order in large N).\nA\nbeautiful fact is that a candidate gauge theory operator exists precisely when the\ngauge group is SO(N) with N even: it is the \u201cPfa\ufb03an\u201d operator,\n1\n(N/2)!\u01eba1a2...aN\u03c6a1a2 . . . \u03c6aN\u22121aN .\n(4.23)\nHere the \ufb01elds \u03c6ab are the adjoint scalar bosons which are the N = 4 superpartners\nof the gauge bosons. We have suppressed their global \ufb02avor index. A similar wrapped\n3-brane was discussed in section 4.1.3, where the 3-brane was wrapped around the\n3-cycle of T 11 (which is topologically S2 \u00d7 S3).\nIt is also interesting to consider branes with spatial extent in AdS5. Strings in AdS5\nwere discussed in section 3.5. A three-brane in AdS5 (by which we mean any wrapped\nbrane with three dimensions of spatial extent in AdS5) aligned with one direction\nperpendicular to the boundary must correspond to some sort of domain wall in the\n\ufb01eld theory. Some examples are obvious: in AdS5 \u00d7 S5, if the three-brane is a D3-\nbrane, then crossing the domain wall shifts the 5-form \ufb02ux and changes the gauge group\nfrom SU(N) to SU(N + 1) or SU(N \u22121). A less obvious example was considered in\n[216]: crossing a D5-brane or NS5-brane wrapped on some RP2 \u2282RP5 changes the\ndiscrete torsion of the RR or NS B-\ufb01eld, and so one can switch between SO(N) and\nSp(N/2) gauge groups. D5-branes on homology 2-cycles of the base of conifolds and\norbifolds have also been studied [218, 383, 359, 407], and the conclusion is that they\ncorrespond to domain walls across which the rank of some factor in the product gauge\ngroup is incremented.\nAnother brane wrapping possibility is branes with two dimensions of spatial extent\nin AdS5. These become strings in the gauge theory when they are oriented with one\ndimension along the radial direction. In a particular model (an SU(N)3 gauge theory\nwhose string theory image is AdS5\u00d7S5/Z3) the authors of [359] elucidated their mean-\ning: they are strings which give rise to a monodromy for the wave-functions of particles\ntransported around them. The monodromy belongs to a discrete symmetry group of\nthe gauge theory. The familiar example of such a phenomenon is the Aharonov-Bohm\ne\ufb00ect, where the electron\u2019s wave-function picks up a U(1) phase when it is transported\naround a tube of magnetic \ufb02ux. The analysis of [359] extends beyond their speci\ufb01c\nmodel, and applies in particular to strings in SO(N) gauge theories, with N even,\nobtained from wrapping a D3-brane on a generator of H1(RP5, Z), where the RP5 has\nno discrete torsion.\nFinally, we turn to one of the most familiar examples of a non-perturbative object\nin gauge theory: the instanton. The obvious candidate in string theory to describe an\ninstanton is the D-instanton, also known as the D(-1)-brane. The correspondence in\n131\n\n\nthis case has been treated extensively in the literature [408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413,\n414, 415]. The presentation in [415] is particularly comprehensive, and the reader who\nis interested in a more thorough review of the subject can \ufb01nd it there. Note that the\nanalysis of instantons in large N gauge theories is problematic since their contribution\nis (at least naively) highly suppressed; the k instanton contribution comes with a factor\nof e\u22128\u03c02k/g2\nY M = e\u22128\u03c02kN/\u03bb which goes like e\u2212N in the \u2019t Hooft limit. Therefore, we can\nonly discuss instanton contributions to quantities that get no other contributions to\nany order in the 1/N expansion. Luckily, such quantities exist in the N = 4 SYM\ntheory, like the one discussed below.\nThe Einstein metric on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 is una\ufb00ected by the presence of a D-instanton.\nThe massless \ufb01elds in \ufb01ve dimensions which acquire VEV\u2019s in the presence of a D-\ninstanton are the axion and the dilaton: in a coordinate system for the Poincar\u00b4e patch\nof AdS5 where\nds2 = R2\nz2\n\u0010\ndx2\n\u00b5 + dz2\u0011\n,\n(4.24)\nwe have [409, 410, 411, 413], asymptotically as z \u21920,\ne\u03c6 = gs + 24\u03c0\nN2\nz4\u02dcz4\n[\u02dcz2 + (x\u00b5 \u2212\u02dcx\u00b5)2]4 + . . . ,\n\u03c7 = \u03c7\u221e\u00b1 (e\u2212\u03c6 \u22121/gs) ,\n(4.25)\nfor a D-instanton whose location in anti-de Sitter space is (\u02dcx\u00b5, \u02dcz). It can be shown using\nthe general prescription for computing correlation functions that this corresponds in\nthe gauge theory to a VEV\n\u27e8TrF 2(x)\u27e9= 192\n\u02dcz4\n[\u02dcz2 + (x\u00b5 \u2212\u02dcx\u00b5)2]4 ,\n(4.26)\nwhich is exactly right for the self-dual background which describes the instanton in\ngauge theory.\nThe action of a D-instanton, 2\u03c0/gs, also matches the action of the\ninstanton, 8\u03c02/g2\nY M, because of the relation g2\nY M = 4\u03c0gs. The result (4.26) is insensitive\nto whether the D-instanton is localized on the S5, since the \ufb01eld under consideration\nis an SO(6) singlet. It is a satisfying veri\ufb01cation of the interpretation of the variable\nz as inverse energy scale that the position \u02dcz of the D-instanton translates into the size\nof the gauge theory instanton. In other words, we understand the AdS5 factor (which\nappears in the moduli space of an SU(2) instanton) as merely specifying the position\nof the D-instanton in the \ufb01ve-dimensional bulk theory.\nIn fact, at large N, a Yang-Mills instanton is parametrized not only by a point in\nAdS5, but also by a point in S5. The S5 emerges from keeping track of the fermionic\ninstanton zero modes properly [415]. The approach is to form a bilinear \u039bAB in the zero\nmodes. \u039bAB is antisymmetric in the four-valued SU(4) indices A and B, and satis\ufb01es\n132\n\n\na hermiticity condition that makes it transform in the real 6 of SO(6). Dual variables\n\u03c7AB can be introduced into the path integral which have the same antisymmetry and\nhermiticity properties: the possible values of \u03c7AB correspond to points in R6. When the\nfermions are integrated out, the resulting determinant acts as a potential for the \u03c7AB\n\ufb01elds, with a minimum corresponding to an S5 whose radius goes into the determination\nof the overall normalization of correlation functions.\nBuilding on the work of [408] on \u03b1\u2032 corrections to the four-point function of stress-\ntensors, the authors of [411] have computed contributions to correlators coming from\ninstanton sectors of the gauge theory and successfully matched them with D-instanton\ncalculations in string theory. It is not entirely clear why the agreement is so good,\nsince the gauge theory computations rely on small \u2019t Hooft coupling (while the string\ntheory computations are for \ufb01xed g2\nY M in the large N limit) and non-renormalization\ntheorems are not known for the relevant correlators. The simplest example turns out\nto be the sixteen-point function of superconformal currents \u02c6\u039bA\n\u03b1 = Tr(\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2F \u2212\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03b2A),\nwhere F \u2212\n\u00b5\u03bd is the self-dual part of the \ufb01eld-strength, A is an index in the fundamental\nof SU(4), \u03b1 and \u03b2 are Lorentz spinor indices, and \u00b5 and \u03bd are the usual Lorentz vector\nindices. One needs sixteen insertions of \u02c6\u039b to obtain a non-zero result from the sixteen\nGrassmannian integrations over the fermionic zero modes of an instanton. The gauge\ntheory result for gauge group SU(2) turns out to be\n* 16\nY\np=1\ng2\nY M \u02c6\u039bAp\n\u03b1p (xp)\n+\n=211316\n\u03c010 g8\nY Me\n\u22128\u03c02\ng2\nY M\n+i\u03b8Y M Z d4\u02dcx d\u02dcz\n\u02dcz5\nZ\nd8\u03b7 d8\u00af\u03be\n16\nY\np=1\n\"\n\u02dcz4\n[\u02dcz2 + (xp \u2212\u02dcx)2]4\n1\n\u221a\n\u02dcz\n\u0010\n\u02dcz\u03b7Ap\n\u03b1p + (xp \u2212\u02dcx)\u00b5\u03c3\u00b5\n\u03b1p \u02d9\u03b1p \u00af\u03be \u02d9\u03b1pAp\u0011#\n.\n(4.27)\nThe superconformal currents \u02c6\u039bA\n\u03b1 are dual to spin 1/2 particles in the bulk: dilatinos\nin ten dimensions which we denote \u039b. One of the superpartners of the well-known\nR4 term in the superstring action (see for example [416]) is the sixteen-fermion vertex\n[417]: in string frame,\nL = e\u22122\u03c6\n\u03b1\u20324 R + . . . +\n e\u2212\u03c6/2\n\u03b1\u2032 f16(\u03c4, \u00af\u03c4)\u039b16 + c.c\n!\n+ . . . ,\n(4.28)\nwhere f16(\u03c4, \u00af\u03c4) is a modular form with weight (12, \u221212), and \u03c4 is the complex coupling\nof type IIB theory:\n\u03c4 = \u03c7 + ie\u2212\u03c6 = \u03b8Y M\n2\u03c0 + 4\u03c0i\ng2\nY M\n.\n(4.29)\nThere is a well-de\ufb01ned expansion of this modular form in powers of e2\u03c0i\u03c4, e\u22122\u03c0i\u00af\u03c4, and\ng2\nY M. Picking out the one-instanton contribution and applying the prescription for\ncalculating Green\u2019s functions laid out in section 3.3, one recovers the form (4.27) up\n133\n\n\nto an overall factor. The overall factor can only be tracked down by redoing the gauge\ntheory calculation with gauge group SU(N), with proper attention paid to the saddle\npoint integration over fermionic zero modes, as alluded to in the previous paragraph.\nThe computation of Green\u2019s functions such as (4.27) has been extended in [415] to the\ncase of multiple instantons. Here one starts with a puzzle. The D-instantons e\ufb00ectively\nform a bound state because integrations over their relative positions converge. Thus\nthe string theory result has the same form as (4.27), with only a single integration\nover a point (\u02dcx, \u02dcz) in AdS5. In view of the emergence of an S5 from the fermionic\nzero modes at large N, the expectation on the gauge theory side is that the moduli\nspace for k instantons should be k copies of AdS5 \u00d7 S5. But through an analysis of\nsmall \ufb02uctuations around saddle points of the path integral it was shown that most of\nthe moduli are lifted quantum mechanically, and what is left is indeed a single copy\nof AdS5 \u00d7 S5 as the moduli space, with a prefactor on the saddle point integration\ncorresponding to the partition function of the zero-dimensional SU(k) gauge theory\nwhich lives on k coincident D-instantons. It is assumed that k \u226aN. Although the\nk instantons \u201cclump\u201d in moduli space, their \ufb01eld con\ufb01gurations involve k commuting\nSU(2) subgroups of the SU(N) gauge group. The correlation functions computed in\ngauge theory have essentially the same form as (4.27). In comparing with the string\ntheory analysis, one picks out the k-instanton contribution in the Taylor expansion\nof the modular form in (4.28). There is perfect agreement at large N for every \ufb01nite\nk, which presumably means that there is some unknown non-renormalization theorem\nprotecting these terms.\n4.3\nDeformations of the Conformal Field Theory\nIn this section we discuss deformations of the conformal \ufb01eld theory, and what they\ncorrespond to in its dual description involving string theory on AdS space. We will\nfocus on the case of the N = 4 \ufb01eld theory, though the general ideas hold also for\nall other examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We start in section 4.3.1 with a\ngeneral discussion of deformations in \ufb01eld theory and in the dual description. Then\nin section 4.3.2 we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to prove a restricted c-theorem.\nIn section 4.3.3 we discuss the interesting relevant and marginal deformations of the\nN = 4 SYM \ufb01eld theory; and in section 4.3.4 we review what is known about these\ndeformations from the point of view of type IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5. The\nresults we present will be based on [418, 148, 147, 149, 419, 145].\n134\n\n\n4.3.1\nDeformations in the AdS/CFT Correspondence\nConformal \ufb01eld theories have many applications in their own right, but since our main\ninterest (at least in the context of four dimensional \ufb01eld theories) is in studying non-\nconformal \ufb01eld theories like QCD, it is interesting to ask how we can learn about non-\nconformal \ufb01eld theories from conformal \ufb01eld theories. One way to break conformal\ninvariance, described in section 3.6, is to examine the theory at \ufb01nite temperature.\nHowever, it is also possible to break conformal invariance while preserving Lorentz\ninvariance, by deforming the action by local operators,\nS \u2192S + h\nZ\nd4xO(x),\n(4.30)\nfor some Lorentz scalar operator O and some coe\ufb03cient h.\nThe analysis of such a deformation depends on the scaling dimension \u2206of the op-\nerator O 12. If \u2206< 4, the e\ufb00ect of the deformation is strong in the IR and weak in\nthe UV, and the deformation is called relevant. If \u2206> 4, the deformation is called\nirrelevant, and its e\ufb00ect becomes stronger as the energy increases. Since we generally\ndescribe \ufb01eld theories by starting with some UV \ufb01xed point and \ufb02owing to the IR, it\ndoes not really make sense to start with a CFT and perform an irrelevant deformation,\nsince this would really require a new UV description of the theory. Thus, we will not\ndiscuss irrelevant deformations here. The last case is \u2206= 4, which is called a marginal\ndeformation, and which does not break conformal invariance to leading order in the\ndeformation. Generally, even if the dimension of an operator equals 4 in some CFT,\nthis will no longer be true after deforming by the operator, and conformal invariance\nwill be broken. Such deformations can be either marginally relevant or marginally ir-\nrelevant, depending on the dimension of the operator O for \ufb01nite small values of h. In\nspecial cases the dimension of the operator will remain \u2206= 4 for any value of h, and\nconformal invariance will be present for any value of h. In such a case the deformation\nis called exactly marginal, and the conformal \ufb01eld theories for all values of h are called\na \ufb01xed line (generalizing the concept of a conformal \ufb01eld theory as a \ufb01xed point of the\nrenormalization group \ufb02ow). When a deformation is relevant conformal invariance will\nbe broken, and there are various possibilities for the IR behavior of the \ufb01eld theory. It\ncan either \ufb02ow to some new conformal \ufb01eld theory, which can be free or interacting, or\nit can \ufb02ow to a trivial \ufb01eld theory (this happens when the theory con\ufb01nes and there\nare no degrees of freedom below some energy scale \u039b). We will encounter examples of\nall of these possibilities in section 4.3.3.\nThe analysis of deformations in the dual string theory on AdS space follows from\nour description of the matching of the partition functions in sections 3.1 and 3.3.\n12If the operator does not have a \ufb01xed scaling dimension we can write it as a sum of operators which\nare eigenfunctions of the scaling operator, and treat the deformation as a sum of the appropriate\ndeformations.\n135\n\n\nThe \ufb01eld theory with the deformation (4.30) is described by examining string theory\nbackgrounds in which the \ufb01eld \u03c6 on AdS space, which corresponds to the operator O,\nbehaves near the boundary of AdS space like \u03c6(x, U) U\u2192\u221e\n\u2212\u2192hU\u2206\u22124, where [O] = \u2206and\nwe use the coordinate system (2.27) (with U instead of u). In principle, we should sum\nover all backgrounds with this boundary condition. Note that, as mentioned in section\n3.3, in Minkowski space this involves turning on the non-normalizable solution to the\n\ufb01eld equations for \u03c6(x, U); turning on the normalizable mode (as done for instance in\n[420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426]) cannot be understood as a deformation of the \ufb01eld\ntheory, but instead corresponds to a di\ufb00erent state in the same \ufb01eld theory [427]13.\nAs in the \ufb01eld theory, we see a big di\ufb00erence between the cases of \u2206> 4 and \u2206< 4.\nWhen \u2206> 4, the deformation grows as we approach the boundary, so the solution near\nthe boundary will no longer look like AdS space; this is analogous to the fact that we\nneed a new UV description of the \ufb01eld theory in this case. On the other hand, when\n\u2206< 4, the solution goes to zero at the boundary, so asymptotically the solution just\ngoes over to the AdS solution, and the only changes will be in the interior. For \u2206= 4\nthe solution naively goes to a constant at the boundary, but one needs to analyze the\nbehavior of the string theory solutions beyond the leading order in the deformation\nto see if the exact solution actually grows as we approach the boundary (a marginally\nirrelevant deformation), decreases there (a marginally relevant deformation) or goes to\na constant (an exactly marginal deformation).\nAn exactly marginal deformation will correspond to a space of solutions of string\ntheory, whose metric will always include an AdS5 factor14, but the other \ufb01elds can\nvary as a function of the deformation parameters. A relevant (or marginally relevant)\ndeformation will change the behavior in the interior, and the metric will no longer be\nthat of AdS space. If we start in the regime of large gsN where there is a supergrav-\nity approximation to the space, the deformation may be describable in supergravity\nterms, or it may lead to large \ufb01elds and curvatures in the interior which will cause the\nsupergravity approximation to break down. The IR behavior of the corresponding \ufb01eld\ntheory will be re\ufb02ected in the behavior of the string theory solution for small values\nof U (away from the boundary). If the solution asymptotes to an AdS solution also at\nsmall U, the \ufb01eld theory will \ufb02ow in the IR to a non-trivial \ufb01xed point15. Note that\nthe variables describing this AdS space may be di\ufb00erent from the variables describing\nthe original (UV) AdS space, for instance the form of the SO(4, 2) isometries may be\n13Some of the solutions considered in [423] may correspond to actual deformations of the \ufb01eld theory.\n14The full space does not necessarily have to be a direct product AdS5 \u00d7 X, but could also be a\n\ufb01bration of AdS5 over X, which also has the SO(4, 2) isometry group.\n15Four dimensional \ufb01eld theories are believed [389] to have a c-theorem analogous to the 2-\ndimensional c-theorem [77] which states that the central charge of the IR \ufb01xed point will be smaller\nthan that of the UV \ufb01xed point. We will discuss some evidence for this in the AdS context, based on\nthe analysis of the low-energy gravity theory, in the next subsection.\n136\n\n\ndi\ufb00erent [147]. If the solution is described in terms of a space which has a non-zero\nminimal value of U (similar to the space which appears in the AdS-Schwarzschild black\nhole solution described in section 3.6, but in this case with the full ISO(3, 1) isom-\netry group unbroken) the \ufb01eld theory will con\ufb01ne and be trivial in the IR. In other\ncases the geometrical description of the space could break down for small values of U;\npresumably this is what happens when the \ufb01eld theory \ufb02ows to a free theory in the IR.\n4.3.2\nA c-theorem\nWithout a detailed analysis of matter \ufb01elds involved in non-anti-de Sitter geometries,\nthere are few generalities one can make about the description of renormalization group\n\ufb02ows in the AdS/CFT correspondence16. However, there is one general result in gravity\n[145] (see also [148]) which translates into a c-theorem via the correspondence. Let us\nconsider D-dimensional metrics of the form\nds2 = e2A(r)(\u2212dt2 + d\u20d7x2) + dr2 .\n(4.31)\nAny metric with Poincar\u00b4e invariance in the t,\u20d7x directions can be brought into this form\nby an appropriate choice of the radial variable r. Straightforward calculations yield\n\u2212(D \u22122)A\u2032\u2032 = Rt\nt \u2212Rr\nr = Gt\nt \u2212Gr\nr = \u03ba2\nD(T t\nt \u2212T r\nr ) \u22650 .\n(4.32)\nIn the second to last step we have used Einstein\u2019s equation, and in the last step we\nhave assumed that the weak energy condition holds in the form\nT\u00b5\u03bd\u03b6\u00b5\u03b6\u03bd \u22650\n(4.33)\nfor any null vector \u03b6\u00b5. This form of the weak energy condition is also known as the\nnull energy condition, and it is obeyed by all \ufb01elds which arise in Kaluza-Klein com-\npacti\ufb01cations of supergravity theories to D dimensions. Thus, we can take it as a fairly\ngeneral fact that A\u2032\u2032 \u22640 for D > 2. Furthermore, the inequality is saturated precisely\nfor anti-de Sitter space, where the only contribution to T\u00b5\u03bd is from the cosmological\nconstant. Thus in particular, any deformation of AdSD arising from turning on scalar\n\ufb01elds will cause A to be concave as a function of r. If we are interested in relevant\ndeformations of the conformal \ufb01eld theory, then we should recover linear behavior in A\nnear the boundary, which corresponds to the (conformal) ultraviolet limit in the \ufb01eld\ntheory. Without loss of generality, then, we assume A(r) \u223cr/\u2113as r \u2192\u221e.\nThe inequality A\u2032\u2032 \u22640 implies that the function\nC(r) \u2261\n1\nA\u2032D\u22122\n(4.34)\n16See [428, 429, 430, 431, 432] for general discussions of the renormalization group \ufb02ow in the context\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n137\n\n\ndecreases monotonically as r decreases. Now, suppose there is a region where A is nearly\nlinear over a range of r corresponding to many orders of magnitude of eA(r). This is\nthe bulk analog of a scaling region in the boundary \ufb01eld theory. The asymptotically\nlinear behavior of A(r) as r \u2192\u221eindicates an ultraviolet scaling region which extends\narbitrarily high in energy. If A(r) recovers linear behavior as r \u2192\u2212\u221e, there is an\ninfrared scaling region; and there could also be large though \ufb01nite scaling regions in\nbetween. Assuming odd bulk dimension D, the perfect AdSD spacetime which any\nsuch scaling region approximates leads to an anomalous VEV\n\u27e8T \u00b5\n\u00b5 \u27e9= universal\nA\u2032D\u22122\n,\n(4.35)\nwhere the numerator is a combination of curvature invariants which can be read o\ufb00\nfrom the analysis of [226] (see section 3.2.2). The point is that in limits where conformal\ninvariance is recovered, the expression (4.34) coincides with the anomaly coe\ufb03cients of\nthe boundary \ufb01eld theory, up to factors of order unity which are universal for all CFT\u2019s\nin a given dimension. Thus, C(r) is a c-function, and the innocuous inequality A\u2032\u2032 \u22640\namounts to a c-theorem provided that Einstein gravity is a reliable approximation to\nthe bulk physics.\nIn geometries such as the interpolating kinks of [148, 147, 145] (discussed in more\ndetail in section 4.3.4), the outer anti-de Sitter region is distinguishable from the inner\none in that it has a boundary. There can only be one boundary (in Einstein frame)\nbecause A gets large and positive only once. In fact, the inner anti-de Sitter region has\n\ufb01nite proper volume if the coordinates t and \u20d7x in (4.31) are made periodic. Supergravity\nis capable of describing irreversible renormalization group \ufb02ows despite the reversibility\nof the equations, simply because the basic prescription for associating the partition\nfunctions of string theory and \ufb01eld theory makes use of the unique boundary.\n4.3.3\nDeformations of the N = 4 SU(N) SYM Theory\nThe most natural deformations to examine from the \ufb01eld theory point of view are mass\ndeformations, that would give a mass to the scalar and/or fermion \ufb01elds in the N = 4\nvector multiplet. One is tempted to give a mass to all the scalars and fermions in the\ntheory, in order to get a theory that will \ufb02ow to the pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory\nin the IR. Such a deformation would involve operators of the form Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6I) for the\nscalar masses, and [\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2Tr(\u03bb\u03b1A\u03bb\u03b2B) + c.c.] for the fermion masses. In the weak coupling\nregime of small \u03bb = g2\nY MN, such deformations indeed make sense and would lead to\na pure Yang-Mills theory in the IR. However, the analysis of this region requires an\nunderstanding of the string theory in the high-curvature region which corresponds to\nsmall \u03bb, which is not yet available. With our present knowledge of string theory we\nare limited to analyzing the strong coupling regime of large \u03bb, where supergravity is\n138\n\n\na good approximation to the full string theory. In this regime there are two problems\nwith the mass deformation described above :\n\u2022 The operator Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6I) is a non-chiral operator, so the analysis of section 3.2.1\nsuggests that for large \u03bb it acquires a dimension which is at least as large as\n\u03bb1/4, and in particular for large enough values of \u03bb it is an irrelevant operator.\nThus, we cannot deform the theory by this operator for large \u03bb. In any case\nthis operator is not dual to a supergravity \ufb01eld, so analyzing the corresponding\ndeformation requires going beyond the supergravity approximation.\n\u2022 The pure YM theory is a con\ufb01ning theory which dynamically generates a mass\nscale \u039bY M, which is the characteristic mass scale for the particles (glueballs) of\nthe theory. When we deform the N = 4 theory by a mass deformation with\na mass scale m, a one-loop analysis suggests that the mass scale \u039bY M will be\ngiven by \u039bY M \u223cme\u2212c/g2\nY M (m)N, where c is a constant which does not depend on\nN (arising from the one-loop analysis) and g2\nY M(m) is the coupling constant at\nthe scale m. Thus, we \ufb01nd that while for small \u03bb we have \u039bY M \u226am and there\nis a separation of scales between the dynamics of the massive modes and the\ndynamics of the YM theory we want to study, for large \u03bb we have \u039bY M \u223cm and\nthere is no such separation of scales (for non-supersymmetric mass deformations\nthe one-loop analysis we made is not exact, but an exact analysis is not expected\nto change the qualitative behavior we describe). Thus, we cannot really study\nthe pure YM theory, or any other con\ufb01ning theory (which does not involve all\nthe \ufb01elds of the original N = 4 theory) as long as we are in the strong coupling\nregime where supergravity is a good approximation.\nWe will see below that, while we can \ufb01nd ways to get around the \ufb01rst problem and\ngive masses to the scalar \ufb01elds, there are no known ways to solve the second problem\nand study interesting con\ufb01ning \ufb01eld theories using the supergravity approximation. Of\ncourse, in the full string theory there is no such problem, and the mass deformation\ndescribed above, for small \u03bb, gives an implicit string theory construction of the non-\nsupersymmetric pure YM theory.\nIn the rest of this section we will focus on the deformations that can arise in the\nstrong coupling regime, and which may be analyzed in the supergravity approximation.\nAs described in section 3.2.1, the only operators whose dimension remains small for\nlarge N and large \u03bb are the chiral primary operators, so we are limited to deforma-\ntions by these operators. Let us start by analyzing the symmetries that are preserved\nby such deformations.\nMost of the chiral operators are in non-trivial SU(4)R rep-\nresentations, so they break the SU(4)R group to some subgroup which depends on\nthe representation of the operator we are deforming by.\nGeneric deformations will\nalso completely break the supersymmetry. One analyzes how much supersymmetry a\n139\n\n\nparticular deformation breaks by checking how many supercharges annihilate it. For\nexample, deformations which preserve N = 1 supersymmetry are annihilated by the\nsupercharges Q\u03b1 and \u00afQ \u02d9\u03b1 of some N = 1 subalgebra of the N = 4 algebra. Given\nthe structure of the chiral representations described in section 3.2.1 it is easy to see\nif a deformation by such an operator preserves any supersymmetry or not. Exam-\nples of deformations which preserve some supersymmetry are superpotentials of the\nform W = hTr(\u03a6i1\u03a6i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03a6in), which to leading order in h add to the Lagrangian a\nterm of the form [h\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2Tr(\u03bb\u03b1A1\u03bb\u03b2A2\u03c6I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6In\u22122) + c.c.]. These operators are part of\nthe scalar operators described in section 3.2.1 arising at dimension n + 1 in the chiral\nmultiplet. In order to preserve supersymmetry one must also add to the Lagrangian\nvarious terms of order h2, so we see that the question of whether a deformation breaks\nsupersymmetry or not depends not only on the leading order operator we deform by\nbut also on additional operators which we may or may not add at higher orders in the\ndeformation parameter (note that the form of the chiral operators also changes when\nwe deform, so an exact analysis of the deformations beyond the leading order in the\ndeformation is highly non-trivial). Another example of a supersymmetry-preserving\ndeformation is a superpotential of the form W = hTr(W 2\n\u03b1\u03a6i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03a6in\u22122), which deforms\nthe theory by some of the scalar operators arising at dimension n + 2 in the chiral\nmultiplet (e.g. the dilaton deformation for n = 2, which actually preserves the full\nN = 4 supersymmetry).\nThe list of chiral operators which correspond to marginal or relevant deformations\nwas given in section 3.2.1. There is a total of 6 such operators, three of which are\nthe lowest components of the chiral multiplets with n = 2, 3, 417. These operators\nare traceless symmetric products of scalars On = Tr(\u03c6{I1\u03c6I2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6In}), which viewed\nas deformations of the theory correspond to non-positive-de\ufb01nite potentials for the\nscalar \ufb01elds. Thus, at least if we are thinking of the theory on R4 where the scalars\nhave \ufb02at directions before adding the potential, these deformations do not make sense\nsince they would cause the theory to run away along the \ufb02at directions. In particular,\nthe deformation in the 20\u2032 which naively gives a mass to the scalars really creates a\nnegative mass squared for at least some of the scalars, so it cannot be treated as a\nsmall deformation of the UV conformal theory at the origin of moduli space. We will\nfocus here only on deformations by the other 3 operators, which all seem to make sense\nin the \ufb01eld theory.\nOne marginal operator of dimension 4 is the operator which couples to the dilaton,\nwhich is a 1 of SU(4)R, of the form [Tr(F 2\n\u00b5\u03bd) + iTr(F \u2227F) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7].\nDeforming by\nthis operator corresponds to changing the coupling constant \u03c4Y M of the \ufb01eld theory,\nand is known to be an exactly marginal deformation which does not break any of the\n17In a U(N) theory there is an additional scalar operator which is the lowest component of the\nn = 1 multiplet.\n140\n\n\nsymmetries of the theory.\nThe other two relevant or marginal deformations are the scalars of dimension n + 1\nin the n = 2 and n = 3 multiplets. Let us start by describing the relevant deformation,\nwhich is a dimension 3 operator in the 10 of SU(4)R, of the form\nh\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2Tr(\u03bb\u03b1A\u03bb\u03b2B) + Tr([\u03c6I, \u03c6J]\u03c6K)\ni\n,\n(4.36)\nwhere the indices are contracted to be in the 10 of SU(4)R (which is in the symmetric\nproduct of two \u00af4\u2019s and in the self-dual antisymmetric product of three 6\u2019s).\nThis\noperator is complex; obviously when we add it to the Lagrangian we need to add it\ntogether with its complex conjugate. The coe\ufb03cient parametrizing the deformation\nis a complex number ma in the 10 of SU(4)R. Deforming by this operator obviously\ngives a mass to some or all of the fermion \ufb01elds \u03bb, depending on the exact values of\nma. For generic values of ma, all the fermions will acquire a mass and supersymmetry\nwill be completely broken. The scalars will then obtain a mass from loop diagrams in\nthe \ufb01eld theory, so that the low-energy theory below a scale of order ma will be the\npure non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Unfortunately, as described above, for\nlarge \u03bb = g2\nY MN this is not really a good description since this theory will con\ufb01ne at a\nscale \u039bY M of order m. However, for small \u03bb this deformation does enable us to obtain\nthe pure YM theory as a deformation of the N = 4 theory.\nIt is interesting to ask what happens if we give a mass only to some of the fermions.\nIn this case we may or may not preserve some amount of supersymmetry (obviously,\npreserving N = 1 supersymmetry requires leaving at least one adjoint fermion mass-\nless). The deformations which preserve at least N = 1 supersymmetry correspond to\nsuperpotentials of the form W = mijTr(\u03a6i\u03a6j). Choosing an N = 1 subgroup breaks\nSU(4)R to SU(3) \u00d7 U(1)R, and (if we choose the U(1) normalization so that the su-\npercharges decompose as 4 = 31 + 1\u22123) the 10 decomposes as 10 = 62 + 3\u22122 + 1\u22126.\nThe SUSY preserving deformation mij is then in the 62 representation, and it further\nbreaks both the SU(3) and the U(1). In a supersymmetric deformation we obviously\nneed to also add masses of order m2 to some of the scalars; naively this leads to a con-\ntradiction because, as described above, there are no reasonable scalar masses to add\nwhich are in chiral operators. However, at order m2 we have to take into account also\nthe mixings between operators which occur at order m in the deformation18; the form\nof the chiral operators changes after we deform, and they mix with other operators\n(in particular, the form of the operator which is an eigenvalue of the scaling operator\nchanges when we turn on m). In the case of the supersymmetric mass deformation, at\norder m the chiral operator (4.36) described above mixes with the non-chiral Tr(\u03c6I\u03c6I)\noperator giving the scalars a mass, so there is no contradiction. The simplest way\nto see this operator mixing in the SUSY-preserving case is to note that the N = 1\n18Similar mixings were recently discussed in [239].\n141\n\n\nSUSY transformations in the presence of a general superpotential include terms of the\nform {Q\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b2i} \u223c\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\nd \u00af\nW\nd\u00af\u03a6i, which lead to corrections of order m to [Q2, O2] which is the\noperator that we are deforming by.\nThere are two interesting ways to give a mass to only one of the fermions. One of\nthem is a particular case of the SUSY-preserving deformation described above, of the\nform W = mTr(\u03a61\u03a61), which is an element of the 62 of SU(3) \u00d7 U(1), and breaks\nSU(4)R \u2192SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) while preserving N = 1 SUSY (but breaking the conformal\ninvariance). The other possibility is to use the deformation in the 1\u22126, which breaks\nSUSY completely but preserves an SU(3) subgroup of SU(4)R. To leading order in\nthe deformation both possibilities give a mass to one fermion, but at order m2 they\ndi\ufb00er in a way which causes one of them to break SUSY while the other further breaks\nSU(3) \u2192SU(2)\u00d7U(1). At weak coupling we can analyze the order m2 terms in detail.\nIn the SUSY-preserving deformation at order m2 we turn on a scalar mass term of the\nform |m|2Tr[(\u03c61)2 + (\u03c62)2], which may be written in the form\n|m|2\n3 Tr[2(\u03c61)2 + 2(\u03c62)2 \u2212(\u03c63)2 \u2212(\u03c64)2 \u2212(\u03c65)2 \u2212(\u03c66)2] + |m|2\n3 Tr[\u03c6I\u03c6I],\n(4.37)\nwhere the \ufb01rst term is one of the \u2206= 2 chiral operators in the 20\u2032, and the second term\nis a non-chiral operator which arises from the operator mixing as described above (the\nappearance of the second term allows us to add the chiral operator in the \ufb01rst term\nwithout destroying the positivity of the scalar potential). In the non-SUSY deformation\nthe chiral term is not turned on at any order in the deformation (the 20\u2032 representation\ncontains no singlets of SU(3)), and all the scalars get equal masses from the non-chiral\nterm.\nWhich theory do we \ufb02ow to in the IR after turning on such a single-fermion mass\nterm ? In the SUSY-preserving case one can show that we actually \ufb02ow to an N = 1\nSCFT (and, in fact, to a \ufb01xed line of N = 1 SCFTs). Naively, one chiral multiplet\ngets a mass, and we remain with the N = 1 SU(N) SQCD theory with two adjoint\nchiral multiplets, which is expected (based on the amount of matter in the theory)\nto \ufb02ow to an interacting IR \ufb01xed point. In fact, one can prove [419] that there is an\nexactly marginal operator at that \ufb01xed point, which (generally) has a non-zero value in\nthe IR theory we get after the \ufb02ow described above. The full superpotential with the\ndeformation is of the form W = hTr(\u03a61[\u03a62, \u03a63])+mTr(\u03a61\u03a61) (where h is proportional\nto gY M), and to describe the low-energy theory we can integrate out the massive \ufb01eld\n\u03a61 to remain with a superpotential W = \u2212h2\n4mTr([\u03a62, \u03a63]2) for the remaining massless\n\ufb01elds. Naively this superpotential is irrelevant (its dimension at the UV \ufb01xed point\nat weak coupling is 5), but in fact one can show (for instance, using the methods of\n[387]) that it is exactly marginal in the IR theory, so there is a \ufb01xed line of SCFTs\nparametrized by the coe\ufb03cient \u02dch of the superpotential W = \u02dchTr([\u03a62, \u03a63]2). Upon\nstarting from a particular value of gY M in the UV and performing the supersymmetric\n142\n\n\nmass deformation, we will land in the IR at some particular point on the IR \ufb01xed line\n(i.e. some value of \u02dch). The unbroken global U(1) symmetry of the theory becomes the\nU(1)R in the N = 1 superconformal algebra in the IR.\nIt is more di\ufb03cult to analyze the mass deformation which does not preserve SUSY\n(but preserves SU(3)), since we cannot use the powerful constraints of supersymmetry.\nNaively one would expect this deformation to lead to masses (from loop diagrams) for\nall of the scalars, but not for the fermions, since the SU(3) symmetry prevents them\nfrom acquiring a mass. Then, the IR theory seems to be SU(N) Yang-Mills coupled\nto three adjoint fermions, which presumably \ufb02ows to an IR \ufb01xed point (this is what\nhappens for supersymmetric theories with one-loop beta functions of the same order,\nbut it is conceivable also that the theory may con\ufb01ne and generate a mass scale). There\nis no reason for such a \ufb01xed point to have any exactly marginal deformations (in fact,\nthere are no known examples in four dimensions of non-supersymmetric theories with\nexactly marginal deformations), so presumably the \ufb02ow starting from any value of gY M\nalways ends up at the same IR \ufb01xed point. We assumed that the deformation leads\nto positive masses squared for the scalars; it is also possible that it would give rise to\nnegative masses squared for the scalars, in which case the theory on R4 would have no\nvacuum, as described above.\nIf we give a mass to two of the fermions, it is possible to do this with a superpotential\nof the form W = mTr(\u03a61\u03a62) which in fact preserves N = 2 supersymmetry (it gives\nthe N = 2 SQCD theory with one massive adjoint hypermultiplet, which was discussed\nin [433]). This theory is known to dynamically generate a mass scale, at which the\nSU(N) symmetry is broken (at a generic point in the moduli space) to U(1)N\u22121, and\nthe low-energy theory is the theory of (N \u22121) free U(1) vector multiplets. The behavior\nof this theory for large N was discussed in [434]. At special points in the moduli space\nthere are massless charged particles, and at even more special points in the moduli\nspace [435, 436, 437] there are massless electrically and magnetically charged particles\nand the theory is a non-trivial N = 2 SCFT. It is not completely clear which point in\nthe moduli space one would \ufb02ow to upon adding the mass deformation to the N = 4\ntheory. Presumably, without any additional \ufb01ne-tuning one would end up at a generic\npoint in the moduli space which corresponds to a free IR theory.\nIf we give a mass to two fermions while breaking supersymmetry (as above, this\ndepends on the order m2 terms that we add), we presumably end up in the IR with\nYang-Mills theory coupled to two massless adjoint fermions. This theory is expected\nto con\ufb01ne at some scale \u039bY M (which for large g2\nY MN would be of the order of the scale\nm), and lead to a trivial theory in the IR. A similar con\ufb01ning behavior presumably\noccurs if we give a mass to three or four of the fermions (for three fermions we can\ngive a mass while preserving SUSY, and we presumably \ufb02ow in the IR to the con\ufb01ning\nN = 1 pure SYM theory).\n143\n\n\nThe only remaining deformation is the deformation by the \u2206= 4 operator in the 45\nrepresentation, which is in the n = 3 multiplet. A general analysis of this deformation\nis rather di\ufb03cult, so we will focus here on the SUSY preserving case where the defor-\nmation is a superpotential of the form W = hijkTr(\u03a6i\u03a6j\u03a6k), with the coe\ufb03cients hijk\nin the 100 representation in the decomposition 45 = 154 + 100 + 80 + 6\u22124 + \u00af3\u22124 + 3\u22128.\nIt turns out that one can prove (see [387] and references therein) that two of these ten\ndeformations correspond to exactly marginal operators, that preserve N = 1 supercon-\nformal invariance. This can be done by looking at a general N = 1 theory with three\nadjoint chiral multiplets, a gauge coupling g, and a superpotential of the form\nW = h1Tr(\u03a61\u03a62\u03a63+\u03a61\u03a63\u03a62)+h2Tr((\u03a61)3+(\u03a62)3+(\u03a63)3)+h3\u01ebijkTr(\u03a6i\u03a6j\u03a6k). (4.38)\nThis particular superpotential is chosen to preserve a Z3 \u00d7 Z3 global symmetry, where\none of the Z3 factors acts by \u03a61 \u2192\u03a62, \u03a62 \u2192\u03a63, \u03a63 \u2192\u03a61 and the other acts by\n\u03a61 \u2192\u03a61, \u03a62 \u2192\u03c9\u03a62, \u03a63 \u2192\u03c92\u03a63 where \u03c9 is a third root of unity. The second Z3\nsymmetry prevents any mixing between the chiral operators \u03a6i, and the \ufb01rst Z3 can\nthen be used to show that they all have the same anomalous dimension \u03b3(g, h1, h2, h3).\nThe beta function may be shown (using supersymmetry) to be exactly proportional to\nthis gamma function (with a coe\ufb03cient which is a function of g), so that the requirement\nof conformal invariance degenerates into one equation (\u03b3 = 0) in the four variables\ng, h1, h2 and h3, which generically has a 3-dimensional space of solutions. This space\nof solutions corresponds to a 3-dimensional space of N = 1 SCFTs.\nThe general\narguments we used so far do not tell us the form of the 3-dimensional space, but we\ncan now use our analysis of the N = 4 theory to learn more about it. First, we know\nthat the N = 4 line g = h3, h1 = h2 = 0 is a subspace of this 3-dimensional space. We\nalso know that at leading order in the deformation away from this subspace, (h3 + g),\nh1 and h2 correspond to marginal operators (as described above they couple to chiral\noperators of dimension 4), while (h3 \u2212g) couples to a non-chiral operator (in the 15\nof SU(4)R) whose dimension is corrected away from g = 0 (and seems to be large for\nlarge g2\nY MN). Thus, we see that to leading order in the deformation around the N = 4\n\ufb01xed line, the exactly marginal deformations are given by h1 and h2 (which are two\nparticular elements of the 100 representation). It is not known if the other deformations\nin the 45 are marginally relevant, marginally irrelevant or exactly marginal.\n4.3.4\nDeformations of String Theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5\nAs described in section 4.3.1, to analyze the deformations of section 4.3.3 in the AdS\ncontext requires \ufb01nding solutions of string theory with appropriate boundary condi-\ntions. For the exactly marginal deformation in the 1, which corresponds to the dilaton,\nwe already know the solutions, which are just the AdS5 \u00d7S5 solution with any value of\n144\n\n\nthe string coupling \u03c4IIB. The other operators discussed above are identi\ufb01ed in string\ntheory with particular modes of the 2-form \ufb01eld Bab with indices in the S5 direc-\ntions (we view B as a complex 2-form \ufb01eld which contains both the NS-NS and R-R\n2-form \ufb01elds). Thus, the dimension 3 mass deformation would be related to string the-\nory backgrounds in which Bab(x, U, y) U\u2192\u221e\n\u2212\u2192mY (1)\nab (y)/U for some spherical harmonics\nY (1)\nab (y) on S5, and the dimension 4 deformations would be related to backgrounds with\nBab(x, U, y)\nU\u2192\u221e\n\u2212\u2192hY (2)\nab (y). It is clear from the identi\ufb01cation of the superconformal al-\ngebra in the \ufb01eld theory and in the string theory that these deformations break the\nsame supersymmetries in both cases; this can also be checked explicitly (say, to leading\norder in the deformation [418, 148]) by analyzing the SUSY variations of the type IIB\nsupergravity \ufb01elds. The existence of an exactly marginal deformation breaking the\nN = 4 superconformal symmetry to N = 1 superconformal symmetry suggests that\nthe theorem of [438], that forbids \ufb02at space compacti\ufb01cations with di\ufb00erent amounts\nof supersymmetry from being at a \ufb01nite distance from each other in the string theory\nmoduli space, is not valid in AdS compacti\ufb01cations [418, 148].\nSince we know little about string theory in backgrounds with RR \ufb01elds, our analysis\nof such solutions is e\ufb00ectively limited to the supergravity approximation. This already\nlimits our discussion to large \u03bb = gsN, and it limits it further to cases where the\nsolution does not develop large curvatures in the interior. In the supergravity limit one\nwould want to \ufb01nd solutions of type IIB supergravity with the boundary conditions\ndescribed above (with the rest of the \ufb01elds having the same boundary conditions as in\nthe AdS5 \u00d7 S5 case). Unfortunately, no such solutions are known, and they seem to\nbe rather di\ufb03cult to construct. There are 3 possible approaches to circumventing this\nproblem of \ufb01nding exact solutions to type IIB supergravity :\n\u2022 One can try to construct solutions perturbatively in the deformation parameter,\nwhich should be easier than constructing the full exact solution. Unfortunately,\nthis approach does not make sense for the relevant deformations, since already\nat leading order in the deformation (corresponding to the linearized equations of\nmotion around the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 solution) we \ufb01nd that the solution (Bab \u223c1/U)\ngrows to be very large in the interior, so the perturbative expansion does not make\nsense. At best one may hope to have a perturbative expansion in a parameter\nlike m/U (if m is the coe\ufb03cient of a relevant operator of dimension \u2206= 3),\nbut this only makes sense near the boundary. On the other hand, for marginal\ndeformations, and especially for deformations that are supposed to be exactly\nmarginal, this approach makes sense. Exactly marginal deformations correspond\nto solutions which do not depend on the AdS coordinates at all, so a perturbation\nexpansion in the parameters of the deformation seems to be well-de\ufb01ned.\nIn\npractice such a perturbation expansion is quite complicated, and can only be\ndone in the \ufb01rst few orders in the deformation. In the case of the deformation by\n145\n\n\nh1, h2 which was described in \ufb01eld theory above, one can verify that it is an exactly\nmarginal deformation to second order in the deformation, even though additional\nSUGRA \ufb01elds need to be turned on at this order (including components of the\nmetric with S5 indices). This is in fact true for any deformation in the 45. At\nthird order one probably gets non-trivial constraints on which elements of the\n45 can be turned on in an exactly marginal deformation, but the equations of\nmotion of type IIB SUGRA have not yet been expanded to this order. Verifying\nthat the deformations that are exactly marginal in the \ufb01eld theory correspond\nto exactly marginal deformations also in string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 would be a\nnon-trivial test of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n\u2022 There are no known non-trivial solutions of type IIB supergravity which are\nasymptotically of the form described above for the relevant or marginal deforma-\ntions. However, there are several known solutions [174, 121] of type IIB super-\ngravity (in addition to the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 solution) which involve AdS5 spaces and\nhave SO(4, 2) isometries (these solutions need not necessarily be direct products\nAdS5 \u00d7 X), and one can try to guess that they would be the end-points of \ufb02ows\narising from relevant deformations. As long as we are in the supergravity ap-\nproximation, only solutions which are topologically equivalent to AdS5 \u00d7 S5 can\nbe related by \ufb02ows to the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 solution, so we will not discuss here other\ntypes of AdS5 solutions.\nOne such solution was found in [174], which is of the form AdS5 \u00d7X, where X is\nan S1 \ufb01ber over CP 2 (a \u201cstretched \ufb01ve-sphere\u201d), and there is also a 3-form \ufb01eld\nturned on in the compact directions (this is called a Pope-Warner type solution\n[439]).\nThis solution has an SU(3) isometry symmetry (corresponding to an\nSU(3) global symmetry in the corresponding \ufb01eld theory), and it breaks all the\nsupersymmetries. Thus, it is natural to try to identify it with the deformation by\nthe non-supersymmetric single-fermion mass operator described in section 4.3.3,\nwhich has the same symmetries. Unfortunately, as discussed below, this solution\nseems to be unstable.\nAn additional solution, found in [121], exhibits an SO(5) global symmetry. As\ndiscussed below, this solution also appears to be unstable.\n\u2022 The most successful way (to date) of analyzing the appropriate solutions of type\nIIB supergravity has been to restrict attention to the \ufb01ve dimensional N = 8\nsupergravity [124] sector of the theory, which includes only the n = 2 \u201csuper-\ngraviton\u201d multiplet from the spectrum described in section 3.2.1. Unlike the sit-\nuation in \ufb02at-space compacti\ufb01cations, the \ufb01ve dimensional supergravity cannot\nbe viewed as a low-energy limit of the ten dimensional supergravity compacti\ufb01-\ncation in any sense. For instance, the supergraviton multiplet contains \ufb01elds of\n146\n\n\nm2 = \u22124/R2, while other multiplets (in the n = 3, 4 multiplets) which are not\nincluded in the truncation to the \ufb01ve dimensional supergravity theory involve\nmassless \ufb01elds on AdS5. However, it is conjectured that there does exist a con-\nsistent truncation of the type IIB supergravity theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 to the \ufb01ve\ndimensional N = 8 supergravity, in the sense that every solution of the latter can\nbe mapped into a solution of the full type IIB theory (with the other \ufb01elds in type\nIIB supergravity being some functions of the \ufb01ve dimensional SUGRA \ufb01elds). A\nsimilar truncation is believed to exist ([140, 114] and references therein) for the\nrelation between 11 dimensional supergravity compacti\ufb01ed on AdS4 \u00d7S7 and the\nfour dimensional N = 8 gauged supergravity, and for the relation between 11\ndimensional supergravity compacti\ufb01ed on AdS7 \u00d7 S4 and the seven dimensional\ngauged supergravity, and the similarities between the two cases suggest that it\nmay exist also in the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 case (though this has not yet been proven19).\nIn the rest of this section we will assume that such a truncation exists and see\nwhat we can learn from it. Obviously, we can only learn from such a truncation\nabout deformations of the theory by \ufb01elds in the n = 2 multiplet, so we cannot\nanalyze the marginal deformations in the 45 in this way.\nThe \ufb01rst thing one can try to do with the \ufb01ve dimensional N = 8 supergravity\nis to \ufb01nd solutions to the equations of motion with an SO(4, 2) isometry. These\ncorrespond to critical points of the scalar potential of d = 5, N = 8 supergravity,\nwhich is a complicated function of the 42 (=20\u2032 + 10c + 1c) scalar \ufb01elds in the\nn = 2 multiplet. A full analysis of the critical points of this potential has not\nyet been performed, but there are 4 known vacua in addition to the vacuum\ncorresponding to AdS5 \u00d7 S5 :\n(i) There is a non-supersymmetric vacuum with an unbroken SU(3) gauge group.\nThis vacuum is conjectured to correspond to the SU(3)-invariant vacuum of the\nfull type IIB supergravity theory described above, which, as mentioned above,\ncould correspond to a mass deformation of the N = 4 \ufb01eld theory. Additional\nevidence for this correspondence was presented in [148, 147], which constructed a\nsolution of the \ufb01ve dimensional N = 8 supergravity which interpolates between\nthe AdS5 \u00d7 S5 solution and the SU(3)-invariant solution, with the leading defor-\nmation from the AdS5\u00d7S5 solution corresponding exactly to the mass operator in\nthe 1\u22126 in the decomposition 10 = 62+3\u22122+1\u22126, which breaks SU(4)R \u2192SU(3).\nSince this solution is non-supersymmetric, one must verify that the classical solu-\ntion is stable, namely that it does not contain tachyons whose mass is below the\nBreitenlohner-Freedman stability bound (in supersymmetric vacua this is guar-\nanteed; using equation (3.14), such tachyons would correspond to operators of\n19Partial evidence for this was given in [143]. See section 2.2.5 for further discussion.\n147\n\n\ncomplex dimension in the \ufb01eld theory which would contradict its unitarity). It\nhas recently been shown [440] that there are scalars in the gauged supergravity\nmultiplet which do violate the Breitenlohner-Freedman stability bound in the\nexpansion around the SU(3)-invariant solution20 Thus, this is not a consistent\nvacuum of the supergravity theory. The AdS/CFT correspondence then implies\nthat performing this mass deformation at strong coupling leads to some instabil-\nity in the \ufb01eld theory (for instance, it could lead to negative masses squared for\nthe scalar \ufb01elds).\n(ii) There is a non-supersymmetric vacuum with unbroken SO(5) gauge symme-\ntry, which is conjectured to be related to the SO(5)-invariant compacti\ufb01cation\nof type IIB supergravity which we mentioned above. The mass spectrum in this\nvacuum was computed in [147], where it was found that it has a tachyonic particle\nwhose mass is below the stability bound. Thus, even classically this is not really\na vacuum of the supergravity theory (presumably the tachyon would condense\nand the theory would \ufb02ow to some di\ufb00erent vacuum). It was found in [148, 147]\nthat this \u201cvacuum\u201d is related to the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 vacuum by a deformation involv-\ning turning on one of the operators in the 20\u2032 representation; presumably the\ninstability of the supergravity solution is related to the instability of the \ufb01eld\ntheory after performing this deformation.\n(iii) There is [149, 419, 145] a vacuum with SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) unbroken symmetry\nand 8 unbroken supercharges, corresponding to an N = 1 SCFT in the \ufb01eld\ntheory. There is no known corresponding solution of the full type IIB theory,\nbut assuming that 5d SUGRA is a consistent truncation, such a solution must\nexist (though it is not guaranteed that all its curvature invariants will be small,\nas required for the consistency of the supergravity approximation). It is natural\nto identify this vacuum with the IR \ufb01xed point arising from the supersymmetric\nsingle-chiral-super\ufb01eld mass deformation described in section 4.3.3. This is con-\nsistent with the form of the 5d SUGRA \ufb01elds that are turned on in this solution,\nwith the global symmetries of the solution, and with the fact that on both sides\nof the correspondence we have a \ufb01xed line of N = 1 SCFTs (the parameter \u02dch of\nthe \ufb01xed line corresponds to the dilaton on the string theory side; supersymmetry\nprohibits the generation of a potential for this \ufb01eld). Recently this identi\ufb01cation\nwas supported by the construction of the full solution interpolating between the\nN = 4 \ufb01xed point and the N = 1 \ufb01xed point in the 5d SUGRA theory [145].\nSince we have some supersymmetry left in this case, one can also quantitatively\ntest this correspondence by matching the global anomalies of the \ufb01eld theory\n20Except for orbifold constructions, there is no example at the time of writing of a non-\nsupersymmetric AdS5 vacuum which is de\ufb01nitely known to satisfy the stability bound. There are\nhowever non-orbifold, non-supersymmetric AdS3 vacua which are perturbatively stable.\n148\n\n\ndescribed in section 4.3.3 (the SU(N) N = 1 SQCD theory with two adjoint\nchiral multiplets and a superpotential W \u221dTr([\u03a62, \u03a63]2)) with those of the cor-\nresponding SUGRA background, as described in section 3.2.2. The conformal\nanomalies were successfully compared in [419, 145] in the large N limit, giving\nsome evidence for this correspondence (in particular, the conformal anomalies of\nthis theory satisfy a = c, as required for a consistent supergravity approxima-\ntion). The fact that the central charge corresponding to this solution is smaller\nthan that of the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 solution with the same RR 5-form \ufb02ux (note that\nthe RR \ufb02ux is quantized and does not change when we deform) means that this\ninterpretation is consistent with the conjectured four dimensional c-theorem.\n(iv) There is an additional background found in [149] with SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(1)\nunbroken gauge symmetry and no supersymmetry. The mass spectrum of this\nbackground has not yet been computed, so it is not clear if it is stable or not.\nThe SUGRA solution involves giving VEVs to \ufb01elds both in the 20\u2032 and in the\n10, but it is not clear exactly what deformation of the original AdS5 \u00d7 S5 theory\n(if any) this background corresponds to.\nIn principle, one could also use the truncated \ufb01ve dimensional theory to analyze\nother relevant deformations in the 10, which are not expected to give rise to\nconformal \ufb01eld theories in the IR. Presumably most of them would lead to high\ncurvatures in the interior, but perhaps some of them do not and can then be\nanalyzed purely in supergravity.\nTo summarize, the analysis of deformations in string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 is rather\ndi\ufb03cult, but the results that are known so far seem to be consistent with the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. The only known results correspond to deformations which lead to con-\nformal theories in the IR; as discussed in section 4.3.3, these are also the only deforma-\ntions which we would expect to be able to usefully study in general in the supergravity\napproximation. The most concretely analyzed deformation is the single-chiral-fermion\nmass deformation, which seems to lead to another AdS-type background of type IIB\nsupergravity (though only the truncation of this background to the \ufb01ve dimensional\nsupergravity is known so far). In non-supersymmetric cases the analysis of deforma-\ntions is complicated (see, for instance, [338]) by the fact that quantum corrections are\npresumably important in lifting \ufb02at directions, so a classical supergravity analysis is\nnot really enough and the full string theory seems to be needed.\n149\n\n\nChapter 5\nAdS3\nIn this chapter we will study the relation between gravity theories (string theories)\non AdS3 and two dimensional conformal \ufb01eld theories. First we are going to describe\nsome generalities which are valid for any AdS3 quantum gravity theory, and then we\nwill discuss in more detail IIB string theory compacti\ufb01ed on AdS3 \u00d7 S3 \u00d7 M4 with\nM4 = K3 or T 4.\nAdS3 quantum gravity is conjectured to be dual to a two dimensional conformal \ufb01eld\ntheory which can be thought of as living on the boundary of AdS3. The boundary of\nAdS3 (in global coordinates) is a cylinder, so the conformal \ufb01eld theory is de\ufb01ned on\nthis cylinder. We choose the cylinder to have radius one, which is the usual convention\nfor conformal \ufb01eld theories. Of course, all circles are equivalent since this is a conformal\n\ufb01eld theory, but we have to rescale energies accordingly. If the spacetime theory or\nthe conformal \ufb01eld theory contain fermions then they have anti-periodic boundary\nconditions on the circle. The reason is that the circle is contractible in AdS3, and close\nto the \u201ccenter\u201d of AdS3 a translation by 2\u03c0 on the circle looks like a rotation by 2\u03c0,\nand fermions get a minus sign. So, the dual conformal \ufb01eld theory is in the NS-NS\nsector. Note that we will not sum over sectors as we do in string theory, since in this\ncase the conformal \ufb01eld theory describes string theory on the given spacetime and all\nits \ufb01nite energy excitations, and we do not have to second-quantize it.\n5.1\nThe Virasoro Algebra\nThe isometry group of AdS3 is SL(2, R)\u00d7SL(2, R), or SO(2, 2). The conformal group\nin two dimensions is in\ufb01nite. This seems to be, at \ufb01rst sight, a contradiction, since in\nour previous discussion we identi\ufb01ed the conformal group with the isometry group of\nAdS. However, out of the in\ufb01nite set of generators only an SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) sub-\ngroup leaves the vacuum invariant. The vacuum corresponds to empty AdS3, and this\n150\n\n\nsubgroup corresponds to the group of isometries of AdS3. The other generators map\nthe vacuum into some excited states. So, we expect to \ufb01nd that the other generators of\nthe conformal group map empty AdS3 into AdS3 with (for instance) a graviton inside.\nThese other generators are associated to reparametrizations that leave the asymptotic\nform of AdS3 invariant at in\ufb01nity. This problem was analyzed in detail in [441] and\nwe will just sketch the argument here. The metric on AdS3 can be written as\nds2 = R2(\u2212cosh2 \u03c1d\u03c4 2 + sinh2 \u03c1d\u03c62 + d\u03c12).\n(5.1)\nWhen \u03c1 is large (close to the boundary) this is approximately\nds2 \u223cR2 h\n\u2212e2\u03c1d\u03c4 +d\u03c4 \u2212+ d\u03c12i\n,\n(5.2)\nwhere \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2261\u03c4 \u00b1 \u03c6. An in\ufb01nitesimal reparametrization generated by a general vector\n\ufb01eld \u03be\u03b1(\u03c4, \u03c6, \u03c1) changes the metric by g\u03b1\u03b2 \u2192g\u03b1\u03b2 +\u2207\u03b1\u03be\u03b2 +\u2207\u03b2\u03be\u03b1. If we want to preserve\nthe asymptotic form of the metric (5.2), we require that [441]\n\u03be+ = f(\u03c4 +) + e\u22122\u03c1\n2 g\u2032\u2032(\u03c4 \u2212) + O(e\u22124\u03c1) ,\n\u03be\u2212= g(\u03c4 \u2212) + e\u22122\u03c1\n2 f \u2032\u2032(\u03c4 +) + O(e\u22124\u03c1) ,\n\u03be\u03c1 = \u2212f \u2032(\u03c4 +)\n2\n\u2212g\u2032(\u03c4 \u2212)\n2\n+ O(e\u22122\u03c1) ,\n(5.3)\nwhere f(\u03c4 +) and g(\u03c4 \u2212) are arbitrary functions. Expanding the functions f = P Lnen\u03c4 +,\ng = P \u00afLnen\u03c4 \u2212, we recognize the Virasoro generators Ln, \u00afLn. For the cases n = 0, \u00b11\none can \ufb01nd some isometries that reduce to (5.3) at in\ufb01nity, are globally de\ufb01ned, and\nleave the metric invariant. These are the SO(2, 2) isometries discussed above. For the\nother generators it is possible to \ufb01nd a globally de\ufb01ned vector \ufb01eld \u03be, but it does not\nleave the metric invariant.\nIt is possible to calculate the classical Poisson brackets among these generators, and\none \ufb01nds that this classical algebra has a central charge which is equal to [441]\nc =\n3R\n2G(3)\nN\n,\n(5.4)\nwhere G(3)\nN\nis the three dimensional Newton constant.\nSo, this should also be the\ncentral charge of the dual conformal \ufb01eld theory, since (5.3) implies that these Virasoro\ngenerators are acting on the boundary as the Virasoro generators of a 1+1 dimensional\nconformal \ufb01eld theory.\nA simple calculation of the central charge term (5.4) was given in [228]. Under a\ndi\ufb00eomorphism of the form (5.3), the metric near the boundary changes to\nds2 \u2192R2\n\u0014\n\u2212e2\u03c1d\u03c4 +d\u03c4 \u2212+ d\u03c12 + 1\n2(\u22023\n+f)(d\u03c4 +)2 + 1\n2(\u22023\n\u2212g)(d\u03c4 \u2212)2\n\u0015\n.\n(5.5)\n151\n\n\nThe metric retains its asymptotic form, but we have kept track of the subleading\ncorrection.\nThis subleading correction changes the expectation value of the stress\ntensor. If we start with a zero stress tensor, we get\n\u27e8T++\u27e9\u2192\nR\n16\u03c0G(3)\nN\n\u22023\n+f\n(5.6)\nafter the transformation. Under a general conformal transformation, \u03c4 + \u2192\u03c4 ++f(\u03c4 +),\nthe stress tensor changes as\nT++ \u2192T++ + 2\u2202+fT++ + f\u2202+T++ +\nc\n24\u03c0\u22023\n+f.\n(5.7)\nSo, comparing (5.7) with (5.6) we can calculate the central charge (5.4).\nIt is also possible to show that if we have boundary conditions on the metric at\nin\ufb01nity that in the dual conformal \ufb01eld theory correspond to considering the theory\non a curved geometry, then we get the right conformal anomaly [226] (generalizing the\ndiscussion in section 3.2.2).\n5.2\nThe BTZ Black Hole\nThree dimensional gravity has no propagating degrees of freedom. But, if we have a\nnegative cosmological constant, we can have black hole solutions. They are given by\n[442, 443]\nds2 = \u2212(r2 \u2212r2\n+)(r2 \u2212r2\n\u2212)\nr2\ndt2 +\nR2r2\n(r2 \u2212r2+)(r2 \u2212r2\u2212)dr2 + r2(d\u03c6 + r+r\u2212\nr2 dt)2,\n(5.8)\nwith \u03c6 \u2261\u03c6 + 2\u03c0. We can combine the temperature T and the angular momentum\npotential \u2126into\n1\nT\u00b1\n\u22611\nT \u00b1 \u2126\nT ,\n(5.9)\nand their relation to the parameters in (5.8) is r\u00b1 = \u03c0R(T+ \u00b1 T\u2212). The mass and\nangular momentum are\n8G(3)\nN M = R + (r2\n+ + r2\n\u2212)\nR\n,\nJ =\nr\u2212r+\n4G(3)\nN R\n,\n(5.10)\nwhere we are measuring the mass relative to the AdS3 space, which we de\ufb01ne to have\nM = 0 (the scale of the mass is set by the radius of the circle in the dual CFT). This\nis not the usual convention, but it is much more natural in this context since we are\n152\n\n\nmeasuring energies with respect to the NS-NS vacuum. Note that the mass of a black\nhole is always at least\nMmin =\nR\n8G(3)\nN\n= c\n12.\n(5.11)\nThe black hole with this minimum mass (sometimes called the zero mass black hole)\nhas a singularity at r = r+ = r\u2212= 0. All these black holes are locally the same as AdS3\nbut they di\ufb00er by some global identi\ufb01cations [442, 443], i.e. they are quotients of AdS3.\nIn theories that have supersymmetry it can be checked that the zero mass black hole\npreserves some supersymmetries provided that we make the fermions periodic as we go\naround the circle [444], which is something we have the freedom to do once the circle\nis not contractible in the gravity geometry. These supersymmetries commute with the\nHamiltonian conjugate to t. Furthermore, we will see below that if we consider the near\nhorizon geometry of branes wrapped on a circle with periodic boundary conditions for\nthe spinors, we naturally obtain the BTZ black hole with mass Mmin. This leads us\nto identify the M = Mmin BTZ black hole with the RR vacuum of the conformal \ufb01eld\ntheory [444]. The energy Mmin (5.11) is precisely the energy di\ufb00erence between the NS-\nNS vacuum and the RR vacuum. Of course, we could still have the M = Mmin BTZ\nblack hole with anti-periodic boundary conditions as an excited state in the NS-NS\nsector.\nNext, let us calculate the black hole entropy.\nThe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nformula gives\nS = Area\n4G(3)\nN\n= 2\u03c0r+\n4G(3)\nN\n= \u03c02c\n3 (T+ + T\u2212),\n(5.12)\nwhere we used (5.4). We can also calculate this in the conformal \ufb01eld theory. All we\nneed is the central charge of the conformal \ufb01eld theory, which we argued had to be\n(5.4). Then, we can use the general formula [445] for the growth of states in a unitary\nconformal \ufb01eld theory [446, 278], which gives\nS \u223c\u03c02c\n3 (T+ + T\u2212).\n(5.13)\nThus, we see that the two results agree. This result if valid for a general conformal\n\ufb01eld theory as long as we are in the asymptotic high energy regime (where energies\nare measured in units of the radius of the circle), so in particular we need that T \u226b1.\nWhen is the result (5.12) valid? In principle we would say that it is valid as long as\nthe area of the horizon is much bigger than the Planck length, r+ \u226bG(3)\nN . This gives\nT \u226b1/c, which is a much weaker bound on the temperature for large c. So, we see\nthat the corresponding conformal \ufb01eld theory has to be quite special, since the number\nof states should grow as determined by the asymptotics (5.13) for energies that are\nmuch smaller than one would expect for a generic conformal \ufb01eld theory.\n153\n\n\n2 \u03c0\n\u03b2\n2\u03c0\n\u03b2\n2\u03c0\n\u03b2=2\u03c0\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 5.1: Calculation of the partition function at \ufb01nite temperature through the\nEuclidean conformal \ufb01eld theory. Since the two directions are equivalent we can choose\nthe \u201ctime\u201d direction as we wish. The partition function is dual under \u03b2 \u21924\u03c02/\u03b2.\n(a) At low temperatures \u03b2 is large and only the vacuum propagates in the \u03b2 direction.\n(b) At high temperatures, small \u03b2, only the crossed channel vacuum propagates in the\n\u03c6 direction. (c) When \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 we have a sharp transition according to supergravity.\nA related manifestation of this curious feature of the \u201cboundary\u201d conformal \ufb01eld\ntheory is the following. We could consider the canonical ensemble by going to Euclidean\nspace and making the Euclidean time coordinate periodic, \u03c4 = \u03c4 + \u03b2. We consider the\ncase \u2126= 0, the general case is considered in [278]. The conformal \ufb01eld theory is then\nde\ufb01ned on a rectangular two-torus, and the free energy will be the partition function\nof the theory on this two-torus. Due to the thermal boundary condition in the NS\nsector, the two-torus ends up having NS-NS boundary conditions on both circles. In\norder to calculate the partition function in the dual gravitational theory we should \ufb01nd\na three-manifold that has the two-torus as its boundary (the correspondence tells us\nto sum over all such manifolds). One possibility is to have the original AdS3 space\nbut with time identi\ufb01ed, \u03c4 = \u03c4 + \u03b2. The value of the free energy is then given, to\nleading order, by the ground state energy of AdS3. This is the expected result for\nlarge \u03b2, where the torus is very elongated and only the vacuum propagates in the \u03c4\nchannel, see \ufb01gure 5.1(a). For high temperatures, only the vacuum propagates in the\ncrossed channel (\ufb01g. 5.1(b)), and this corresponds to the BTZ black hole in AdS3.\nNote that the Euclidean BTZ geometry is the same as AdS3 but \u201con its side\u201d, with\n\u03c4 \u2194\u03c6, so now the \u03c4 circle is contractible. The transition between the two regimes\noccurs at \u03b2 = 2\u03c0, which corresponds to a square torus (\ufb01g. 5.1(c)). This is a sharp\ntransition when the gravity approximation is correct, i.e. when R/G(3)\nN \u223cc \u226b1. This\nsharp transition will not be present in the partition function of a generic conformal\n\ufb01eld theory, for example it is not present if we consider c free bosons. When we discuss\n154\n\n\nin more detail the conformal \ufb01eld theories that correspond to string theory on AdS3,\nwe will see that they have a feature that makes it possible to explain this transition.\nThis sharp transition is the two dimensional version of the large N phase transition\ndiscussed in section 3.6.2 [185] (in this case c plays the role of N).\n5.3\nType IIB String Theory on AdS3 \u00d7 S3 \u00d7 M 4\nIn this section we study IIB string theory on AdS3 \u00d7 S3 \u00d7 M4 [278, 447]. Throughout\nthis section M4 = K3 or T 4. In this case we can get some insight on the dual confor-\nmal \ufb01eld theory by deriving this duality from D-branes, as we did for the AdS5 \u00d7 S5\ncase.\nWe start with type IIB string theory on M4.\nWe consider a set of Q1 D1\nbranes along a non-compact direction, and Q5 D5 branes wrapping M4 and sharing\nthe non-compact direction with the D1 branes. All the branes are coincident in the\ntransverse non-compact directions. The unbroken Lorentz symmetry of this con\ufb01gura-\ntion is SO(1, 1) \u00d7 SO(4). SO(1, 1) corresponds to boosts along the string, and SO(4)\nis the group of rotations in the four non-compact directions transverse to both branes.\nThis con\ufb01guration also preserves eight supersymmetries, actually N = (4, 4) super-\nsymmetry once we decompose them into left and right moving spinors of SO(1, 1)1.\nIt is possible to \ufb01nd the supergravity solution for this con\ufb01guration (see [448] for a\nreview) and then take the near horizon limit as we did in section 3.1 [5], and we get\nthe metric (in string frame)\nds2\n\u03b1\u2032 =\nU2\ng6\n\u221aQ1Q5\n(\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1) + g6\nq\nQ1Q5\ndU2\nU2 + g6\nq\nQ1Q5d\u21262\n3.\n(5.14)\nThis is AdS3 \u00d7 S3 with radius R2 = R2\nAdS = R2\nS3 = g6\n\u221aQ1Q5l2\ns, where g6 is the\nsix dimensional string coupling. The full ten dimensional geometry also includes an\nM4 factor. In this case the volume of the M4 factor in the near-horizon geometry\nis proportional to Q1/Q5, and it is independent of the volume of the original M4\nover which we wrapped the branes. In the full D1-D5 geometry, which includes the\nasymptotically \ufb02at region, the volume of M4 varies, and it is equal to the above \ufb01xed\nvalue in the near horizon region [449, 450, 451, 452].\n5.3.1\nThe Conformal Field Theory\nThe dual conformal \ufb01eld theory is the low energy \ufb01eld theory living on the D1-D5\nsystem [453]. One of the properties of this conformal \ufb01eld theory that we will need\n1If M 4 = K3 we need that the sign of the D1 brane charge and the sign of the D5 brane charge\nare the same, otherwise we break supersymmetry (except for the single con\ufb01guration with charges\n(Q5, Q1) = (\u00b11, \u22131)).\n155\n\n\nis its central charge, so that we will be able to compare it with supergravity. We can\ncalculate this central charge in a way that is not too dependent on the precise structure\nof the conformal \ufb01eld theory. The conformal \ufb01eld theory that we are interested in is\nthe IR \ufb01xed point of the \ufb01eld theory living on D1-D5 branes. The \ufb01eld theory living\non D1-D5 branes, before we go to the IR \ufb01xed point, is some 1 + 1 dimensional \ufb01eld\ntheory with N = (4, 4) supersymmetry. This amount of supersymmetry is equivalent to\nN = 2 in four dimensions, so we can classify the multiplets in a similar fashion. There\nis a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet. In two dimensions both multiplets have the\nsame propagating degrees of freedom, four scalars and four fermions, but they have\ndi\ufb00erent properties under the SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R global R-symmetry. Under this group\nthe scalars in the hypermultiplets are in the trivial representation, while the scalars\nin the vector multiplet are in the (2, 2). On the fermions these global symmetries\nact chirally. The left moving vector multiplet fermions are in the (1, 2), and the left\nmoving hypermultiplet fermions are in the (2, 1). The right moving fermions have\nsimilar properties with SU(2)L \u2194SU(2)R. The theory can have a Coulomb branch\nwhere the scalars in the vector multiplets have expectation values, and a Higgs branch\nwhere the scalars in the hypermultiplets have expectation values.\nFrom the spacetime origin of the supercharges it is clear that the SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R\nglobal R-symmetry is the same as the SO(4) symmetry of spatial rotations in the 4-\nplane orthogonal to the D1-D5 system [454, 455, 456]. The vector multiplets describe\nmotion of the branes in the transverse directions, this is consistent with their SO(4)\ntransformation properties. The vector multiplet \u201cexpectation values\u201d should be zero\nif we want the branes to be on top of each other. We have put quotation marks since\nexpectation values do not exist in a 1 + 1 dimensional \ufb01eld theory. It is possible to\nshow that if Q1 and Q5 are coprime then, by turning on some of the M4 moduli (more\nprecisely some NS B-\ufb01elds), one can remove the Coulomb branch altogether, forcing\nthe branes to be at the same point in the transverse directions [457, 343].\nSince the fermions transform chirally under SU(2)L, this theory has a chiral anomaly.\nThe chiral anomaly for SU(2)L is proportional to the number of left moving fermions\nminus the number of right moving fermions that transform under this symmetry. The\n\u2019t Hooft anomaly matching conditions imply that this anomaly should be the same at\nhigh and low energies [458]. At high energies (high compared to the IR \ufb01xed point)\nthe anomaly is ka = NH \u2212NV , the di\ufb00erence between the number of vector multiplets\nand hypermultiplets.\nLet us now calculate this, starting with the T 4 case.\nOn a\nD1-D5 brane worldvolume there are massless excitations coming from (1,1) strings,\n(5,5) strings and (1,5) (and (5,1)) strings.\nThe (1,1) or (5,5) strings come from a\nvector multiplet of an N = (8, 8) theory, which gives rise to both a vector multiplet\nand a hypermultiplet of N = (4, 4) supersymmetry, so they do not contribute to the\nanomaly. The massless modes of the (1,5) strings come only in hypermultiplets, and\n156\n\n\nthey contribute to the anomaly with ka = Q1Q5. For the K3 case the analysis is similar.\nThe D5 branes are now wrapped on K3, so the (5,5) strings give rise only to a vector\nmultiplet. The di\ufb00erence from the T 4 case comes from the fact that in the T 4 case\nthe (5,5) hypermultiplet came from Wilson lines on the torus, and on K3 we do not\nhave one-cycles so we do not have Wilson lines. On the \ufb01vebrane worldvolume there\nis (when it is wrapped on K3) an induced one-brane charge equal to Qind\n1\n= \u2212Q5. The\ntotal D1 brane charge is equal to the sum of the charges carried by explicit D1 branes\nand this negative induced charge, Q1 = Qind\n1\n+ QD1\n1\n[459]. Therefore, the number of\nD1 branes is really QD1\n1\n= Q1 + Q5, and the number of (1,5) strings is QD1\n1 Q5. So,\nwe conclude that the anomaly is ka = QD1\n1 Q5 \u2212Q2\n5 = Q1Q5, which in the end is the\nsame result as in the T 4 case. Note that in order to calculate this anomaly we only\nneed to know the massless \ufb01elds, since all massive \ufb01elds live in larger representations\nwhich are roughly like a vector multiplet plus a hypermultiplet, and therefore they do\nnot contribute to the anomaly.\nWhen we are on the Higgs branch all the vectors become massive except for the center\nof mass multiplet, which contains \ufb01elds describing the overall motion of all the branes\nin the four transverse directions. This is just a free multiplet, containing four scalar\n\ufb01elds. On the Higgs branch, at the IR \ufb01xed point, the SU(2)L symmetry becomes a\ncurrent algebra with an anomaly kcft. The total anomaly should be the same, so that\nka = kcft\u22121. The last term comes from the center of mass U(1) vector multiplet (which\nis not included in kcft). So, we conclude that kcft = Q1Q5 + 1. Since the U(1) vector\nmultiplet is decoupled, we drop it in the rest of the discussion and we talk only about\nthe conformal \ufb01eld theory of the hypermultiplets.\nThe N = (4, 4) superconformal\nsymmetry relates the anomaly in the SU(2) current algebra to the central charge,\nc = 6kcft = 6(Q1Q5 + 1). Using the value for the AdS3 radius R = (g2\n6Q1Q5)1/4ls and\nthe three dimensional Newton constant G(3)\nN = g2\n6l4\ns/4R3, we can now check that (5.4)\nis satis\ufb01ed to leading order for large k. This also ensures, as we saw above, that the\nblack hole entropy comes out right.\nNow we will try to describe this conformal \ufb01eld theory a bit more explicitly. We start\nwith Q5 D5 branes, and we view the D1 branes as instantons of the low-energy SYM\ntheory on the \ufb01ve-branes [161]. These instantons live on M4 and are translationally\ninvariant (actually also SO(1, 1) invariant) along time and the x5 direction, where x5\nis the non compact direction along the D5 branes. See \ufb01gure 5.2(a). This instanton\ncon\ufb01guration, with instanton number Q1, has moduli, which are the parameters that\nparameterize a continuous family of solutions (classical instanton con\ufb01gurations). All\nof these solutions have the same energy. Small \ufb02uctuations of this con\ufb01guration (at\nlow energies) are described by \ufb02uctuations of the instanton moduli.\nThese moduli\ncan \ufb02uctuate in time as well as in the x5 direction. See \ufb01gure 5.2(b). So, the low\nenergy dynamics is given by a 1+1 dimensional sigma model whose target space is the\n157\n\n\n(a)\nM\nx5\n4\n(b)\nFigure 5.2: (a) The D1 branes become instantons on the D5 brane gauge theory.\n(b) The instanton moduli can oscillate in time and along x5.\ninstanton moduli space. Let us be slightly more explicit, and choose four coordinates\nx6, ..., x9 parameterizing M4. The instantons are described in the UV SYM theory as\nSU(Q5) gauge \ufb01elds A6,7,8,9(\u03bea; x6, ..., x9) with \ufb01eld strengths which satisfy F = \u22174F,\nwhere \u22174 is the epsilon symbol in M4 and \u03bea are the moduli parameterizing the family of\ninstantons. The dimension of the instanton moduli space for Q1 instantons in SU(Q5)\nis 4k, where\nk \u2261Q1Q5\nfor T 4,\nk \u2261Q1Q5 + 1\nfor K3.\n(5.15)\nThe leading behaviour for large Q is the same. In the T 4 case we have four additional\nmoduli coming from the Wilson lines of the U(1) factor of U(Q5) [460]. It has been\nargued in [456, 461] that the instanton moduli space is a deformation of the symmetric\nproduct of k copies of M4, Sym(M4)k \u2261(M4)k/Sk. The deformation involves blowing\nup the \ufb01xed points of the orbifold, as well as modifying the B-\ufb01elds that live at the\norbifold point. We will discuss this in more detail later. The parameter that blows\nup the singularity can be identi\ufb01ed with one of the supergravity moduli of this solu-\ntion. For some particular value of these moduli (which are not to be confused with\nthe moduli of the instanton con\ufb01guration) the CFT will be precisely the symmetric\nproduct, but at that point the gravity approximation will not be valid, since we will\nsee that the supergravity description predicts fewer states at low conformal weights\nthan the symmetric product CFT. When we deform the symmetric product, some of\nthe states can get large corrections and have high energies (i.e. they correspond to\noperators having high conformal weight). Other studies of this D1-D5 system include\n[462, 463, 464]\n158\n\n\n5.3.2\nBlack Holes Revisited\nWe remarked above that the BTZ black hole entropy can be calculated just from the\nvalue of the central charge, and therefore the gravity result agrees with the conformal\n\ufb01eld theory result. Note that the calculation of the central charge that we did above\nin the CFT is valid for any value of the coupling (i.e. the moduli), so the \ufb01eld theory\ncalculation of the central charge and the entropy is valid also in the black hole regime\n(where the gravity approximation is valid). This should be contrasted to the AdS5\u00d7S5\ncase, where the \ufb01eld theory calculation of the entropy was only done at weak coupling\n(in two dimensions the entropy is determined by the central charge and cannot change\nas we vary moduli). In [465] corrections to the central charge in the gravity picture\nwere analyzed.\nWe noticed above that the gravity description predicted a sharp phase transition\nwhen the temperature was T = 1/(2\u03c0), and we remarked that the \ufb01eld theory had to\nhave some special properties to make this happen. We will now explain qualitatively\nthis phase transition. Our discussion will be qualitative because we will work at the\norbifold point, and this is not correct if we are in the supergravity regime. We will\nsee that the symmetric product has a feature that makes this sharp phase transition\npossible.\nThe orbifold theory can be interpreted in terms of a gas of strings [466, 467]. These\nare strings that wind along x5 and move on M4. The total winding number is k. The\nstrings can be singly wound or multiply wound. In the R-R sector it does not cost any\nenergy to multiply wind the strings. If we have NS-NS boundary conditions, which\nare the appropriate ones to describe AdS3, it will cost some energy to multiply wind\nthe strings. The energy cost in the orbifold CFT is the same as twice the conformal\nweight of the corresponding twist operator, which is h = \u00afh = w/4 + O(1/w) for a\ncon\ufb01guration with winding number w. If the strings are singly wound and we have a\ntemperature of order one (or 1/2\u03c0), we will not have many oscillation modes excited\non these strings, and the entropy will be small.\nNote that the fact that we have\nmany singly wound strings does not help, since we are supposed to symmetrize over\nall strings, so most of the strings will be in similar states and they will not contribute\nmuch to the entropy.\nSo, the free energy of such a state is basically F \u223c0.\nOn\nthe other hand, if we multiply wind all the strings, we raise the energy of the system\nbut we also increase the entropy [468], since now the energy gap of the system will\nbe much lower (the multiply wound strings behave e\ufb00ectively like a \ufb01eld theory on\na circle with a radius which is w times bigger). If we multiply wind w strings, with\nw \u226b1, we get an energy E \u223cw/2 + 2\u03c02wT 2, where the last term comes from thermal\nexcitations along the string. The entropy is also larger, S = 4\u03c02wT. So, the free\nenergy is F = E \u2212TS = w/2\u22122\u03c02wT 2. Comparing this to the free energy of the state\n159\n\n\nwith all strings singly wound, we see that the latter wins when T < 1/(2\u03c0), and the\nmultiply wound state wins when T > 1/(2\u03c0). This explains the presence of the sharp\nphase transition at T = 1/(2\u03c0) when we are at the orbifold point.\nNote that the mass of the black hole at the transition point is M = Mmin + k/2,\nwhich is (for large k) much bigger than the minimum mass for a BTZ black hole, like\nthe situation in other AdSd>3. We could have black holes which are smaller than this,\nbut they cannot be in thermal equilibrium with an external bath. Of course they could\nbe in equilibrium inside AdS3 if we do not couple AdS3 to an external bath to keep the\ntemperature \ufb01nite. In this case we are considering the microcanonical ensemble, and\nthere are more black hole solutions that we could be considering [279, 284, 287].\n(a)\n(b)\nM 4\nx 5\nFigure 5.3: Some con\ufb01gurations with winding number four. (a) Two singly wound\nstrings and one doubly wound string. (b) A maximally multiply wound con\ufb01guration.\nIf we were considering the conformal \ufb01eld theory on a circle with RR boundary\nconditions, the corresponding supergravity background would be the M = Mmin BTZ\nblack hole. This follows from the fact that we should have preserved supersymmetries\nthat commute with the Hamiltonian (in AdS3 the preserved supersymmetries do not\ncommute with the Hamiltonian generating evolution in global time). In order to have\nthese supersymmetries we need to have RR boundary conditions on the circle. Notice\nthat the RR vacuum is not an excited state on the NS-NS vacuum, it is just in a\ndi\ufb00erent sector of the conformal \ufb01eld theory, even though the M = Mmin BTZ black\nhole appears in both sectors.\nIn the case with RR boundary conditions a black hole forms as soon as we raise\nthe temperature (beyond T \u223c1/k). This seems at \ufb01rst sight paradoxical, since the\ntemperature could be much smaller than one, which would be the natural energy gap\nfor a generic conformal \ufb01eld theory on a circle. The reason that the energy gap is very\nsmall for this conformal \ufb01eld theory is due to the presence of \u201clong\u201d, multiply wound\nstrings. In the RR sector all multiply wound strings have the same energy. But, as we\n160\n\n\nsaw before, multiply wound strings lead to higher entropy states so they are preferred.\nIn fact, one can estimate the energy gap of the system by saying that it will be of\nthe order of the minimum energy excitation that can exist on a string multiply wound\nk-times, which is of the order of 1/k. This estimate of the energy gap agrees with a\nsemiclassical estimate as follows. We can trust the thermodynamic approximation for\nblack holes as long as the speci\ufb01c heat is large enough [469]. For any system we need\na large speci\ufb01c heat, Ce \u2261\u2202E\n\u2202T , in order to trust the thermodynamic approximation. In\nthis case E \u223ckT 2, so the condition Ce \u226b1 boils down to E \u226b1/k . So, this estimate\nof the energy gap agrees with the conformal \ufb01eld theory estimate. Note that in the RR\nsupergravity vacuum (the M = Mmin black hole) we could seemingly have arbitrarily\nlow energy excitations as waves propagating on this space. The boundary condition on\nthese waves at the singularity should be such that one gets the above gap, but in the\ngravity approximation k = \u221eand this gap is not seen. Note also that the M = Mmin\nblack hole does not correspond to a single state (as opposed to the AdS3 vacuum), but\nto a large number of states, of the order of e2\u03c0\n\u221a\n2k for T 4 case and e2\u03c0\n\u221a\n4k for K32.\nThere are other black holes that preserve some supersymmetries, which are extremal\nBTZ black holes with M \u2212Mmin = J [444]. J is the angular momentum in AdS3,\nidenti\ufb01ed with the momentum along the S1 in the CFT. Of course, these black holes\nwill preserve supersymmetry only if the boundary conditions on S1 are periodic, i.e.\nonly if we are considering the RR sector of the theory. In the RR sector it becomes more\nnatural to measure energies so that the RR vacuum has zero energy. The extremal\nblack holes correspond to states in the CFT in the RR sector with no left moving\nenergy, \u00afL0 = 0, and some right moving energy, L0 = J > 0. The entropy of these\nstates is\nS = 2\u03c0\n\u221a\nkJ.\n(5.16)\nThis is the entropy as long as kL0 is large, even for L0 = 1. The reason for this is again\nthe presence of multiply wound strings, that ensure that the asymptotic formula for\nthe number of states in a conformal \ufb01eld theory is reached at very low values of L0. In\nthis argument it is important that we are in the RR sector, and since we are counting\nBPS states we can deform the theory until we are at the symmetric product point, and\nthen the argument we gave in terms of multiply wound strings is rigorous [13, 460].\nIt is possible to consider also black holes which carry angular momentum on S3.\nThey are characterized by the eigenvalues JL, JR, of J3\nL and J3\nR of SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R.\nThese rotating black holes can be found by taking the near horizon limit of rotating\nblack strings in six dimensions [470, 471]. Their metric is locally AdS3 \u00d7 S3 but with\nsome discrete identi\ufb01cations [472]. Cosmic censorship implies that their mass has a\n2An easy way to calculate this number of BPS states is to consider this con\ufb01guration as a system\nof D1-D5 branes on S1 \u00d7M 4 and then do a U-duality transformation, transforming this into a system\nof fundamental string momentum and winding.\n161\n\n\nlower bound\nE \u2261M \u2212Mmin \u2265J2\nL/k + J2\nR/k.\n(5.17)\nWe can also calculate the entropy for a general con\ufb01guration carrying angular momenta\nJL,R on S3, linear momentum J on S1, and energy E = M \u2212Mmin :\nS = 2\u03c0\nq\nk(E + J)/2 \u2212J2\nL + 2\u03c0\nq\nk(E \u2212J)/2 \u2212J2\nR.\n(5.18)\nWe can understand this formula in the following way [473, 454]. If we bosonize the\nU(1) currents, JL \u223ck\n2\u2202\u03c6, and similarly for JR, we can construct the operator eiJL\u03c6\nwith conformal weight J2\nL/k. This explains why the minimum mass is (5.17). This also\nexplains (5.18), since only a portion of the energy equal to L0\u2212J2\nL/k = (E+J)/2\u2212J2\nL/k\ncan be distributed freely among the oscillators3.\n5.3.3\nMatching of Chiral-Chiral Primaries\nThe CFT we are discussing here, and also its string theory dual, have moduli (param-\neters of the \ufb01eld theory). At some point in the moduli space the symmetric product\ndescription is valid, and at that point the gravity description is strongly coupled and\ncannot be trusted. As we move away from that point we can get to regions in moduli\nspace where we can trust the gravity description. The energies of most states will\nchange when we change the moduli. There are, however, states that are protected,\nwhose energies are not changed. These are chiral primary states [475]. The supercon-\nformal algebra contains terms of the form4\n{Q++\nr\n, Q\u2212\u2212\ns\n} = 2Lr+s + 2(r \u2212s)J3\nr+s + c\n3\u03b4r+s(r2 \u22121\n4),\n{Q+\u2212\nr\n, Q\u2212+\ns\n} = 2Lr+s + 2(r \u2212s)J3\nr+s + c\n3\u03b4r+s(r2 \u22121\n4),\n(5.19)\nwhere Q\u00b1\u00b1\nr\n= (Q\u2213\u2213\n\u2212r )\u2020, and r, s \u2208Z + 1\n2. The generators that belong to the global\nsupergroup (which leaves the vacuum and AdS3 invariant) have r, s = \u00b11/2. The \ufb01rst\nsuperscript indicates the eigenvalues under the global J3\n0 generator of SU(2), and the\nsecond superscript corresponds to a global SU(2) exterior automorphism of the algebra\nwhich is not associated to a symmetry in the theory. If we take a state |h\u27e9which has\nL0 = J3\n0, then we see from (5.19) that Q+\u00b1\n\u22121/2|h\u27e9has zero norm, so in a unitary \ufb01eld\ntheory it should be zero. Thus, these states are annihilated by Q+\u00b1\n\u22121/2. Moreover, if\na state is annihilated by Q+\u00b1\n\u22121/2 then L0 = J3\n0. These states are called right chiral\nprimaries, and if \u00afL0 = \u00afJ3\n0 it is a left chiral primary. The possible values of J3\n0 for chiral\n3Other black holes were studied in [474].\n4Our normalization for J3\n0 follows the standard SU(2) practice and di\ufb00ers by a factor of two from\nthe U(1) current in [475, 278, 447, 476].\n162\n\n\nprimaries are bounded by J3\n0 \u2264c/6 = k. This can be seen by computing the norm of\nQ+\u00b1\n\u22123/2|h\u27e9. Note that k is the level of the SU(2) current algebra. The values of J3\n0 for\ngeneric states are not bounded. The spins of SU(2) current algebra primary \ufb01elds are\nbounded by J3\n0 \u2264k/2, which is not the same as the bound on chiral primaries.\nLet us now discuss the structure of the supermultiplets under the SU(1, 1|2) subgroup\nof the N = 4 algebra [477]. This is the subgroup generated by the supercharges with\nr, s = \u00b11/2 in (5.19), plus the global SU(2) generators Ja\n0 and the SL(2, R) subgroup\nof the Virasoro algebra. The structure of these multiplets is the following. By acting\nwith Q\u00b1\u00b1\n1/2 on a state we lower its energy, which is the L0 eigenvalue. Energies are all\npositive in a unitary conformal \ufb01eld theory, since L0 eigenvalues are related to scaling\ndimensions of \ufb01elds which should be positive. So, we conclude that at some point Q\u00b1\u00b1\n1/2\nwill annihilate the state. Such a state is also annihilated by L1 (5.19). We call such\na state a primary, or highest weight, state. Then, we can generate all other states by\nacting with Q\u00b1\u00b1\n\u22121/2. See \ufb01gure 5.4. This will give in general a set of 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1\nstates, where we organized the states according to their level. On each of these states\nwe can then act with arbitrary powers of L\u22121. However, we could also have a short\nrepresentation where some of the Q\u22121/2 operators annihilate the state. This will happen\nwhen L0 = \u00b1J3\n0, i.e. only when we have a chiral primary (or an antichiral primary).\nSince by SU(2) symmetry each chiral primary comes with an antichiral primary, we\nconcentrate on chiral primaries. These short multiplets are of the form\nstates\nJ3\n0\nL0\n|0\u27e9\nj\nj\nQ\u2212\u00b1\n\u22121/2|0\u27e9\nj \u22121/2\nj + 1/2\nQ\u2212+\n\u22121/2Q\u2212\u2212\n\u22121/2|0\u27e9\nj \u22121\nj + 1.\n(5.20)\nThe multiplet includes four states (which are SL(2, R) primaries), except in the case\nthat j = 1/2 when the last state is missing. We get a similar structure if we consider\nthe right-moving part of the supergroup.\nWe will \ufb01rst consider states that are left and right moving chiral primaries, with\nL0 = J3\n0 and \u00afL0 = \u00afJ3\n0. From now on we drop the indices on J3\n0, \u00afJ3\n0, and denote the\nchiral primaries by (j,\u00afj).\nBy acting with Q\u2212\u00b1\n\u22121/2 and \u00afQ\u2212\u00b1\n\u22121/2 we generate the whole\nsupermultiplet. We will calculate the spectrum of chiral-chiral primaries both in string\ntheory (in the gravity approximation) and in the conformal \ufb01eld theory at the orbifold\npoint. Since these states lie in short representations we might expect that they remain\nin short representations also after we deform the theory away from the orbifold point.\nActually this argument is not enough, since in principle short multiplets could combine\nand become long multiplets. In the K3 case we can give a better argument. We will\nsee that all chiral primaries that appear are bosonic in nature, while we see from \ufb01gure\n5.4 that we need some bosonic and some fermionic chiral primaries to make a long\nmultiplet. Therefore, all chiral primaries must remain for any value of the moduli.\n163\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n1\n-2\n1\n-2\n1\n-2\n4\n1\n-2\n|\n|\n|\n_\n_\nj\nj+1/2 j+1\n|\n|\nh\n_\n_\n_\nFigure 5.4: Structure of SU(1, 1|2) multiplets.

The minus sign denotes opposite statistics. The full\nsquare is a long multiplet. The encircled states form a short multiplet. Four short\nmultiplets can combine into a long multiplet.\nLet us start with the conformal \ufb01eld theory. Since these states are protected by\nsupersymmetry we can go to the orbifold point Sym(M4)k. The chiral primaries in\nthis case can be understood as follows. In a theory with N = (4, 4) supersymmetry we\ncan do calculations in the RR sector and then translate them into results about the NS-\nNS sector. This process is called \u201cspectral \ufb02ow\u201d, and it amounts to an automorphism\nof the N = 4 algebra. Under spectral \ufb02ow, the chiral primaries of the NS-NS sector\n(that we are interested in) are in one to one correspondence with the ground states\nof the RR sector. It is easier to compute the properties of the RR ground states of\nthe theory. Orbifold conformal \ufb01eld theories, like Sym(M4)k, can be thought of as\ndescribing a gas of strings winding on a circle, the circle where the CFT is de\ufb01ned,\nwith total winding number k and moving on M4.\nThe ground state energies of a\nsingly wound string and a multiply wound string are the same if we are in the RR\nsector. Then, we can calculate a partition function over the RR ground states. It is\nmore convenient to relax the constraint on the total winding number by introducing\na chemical potential for the winding number, and then we can recover the result with\n\ufb01xed winding number by extracting the appropriate term in the partition function as in\n[466]. Since our conformal \ufb01eld theory has \ufb01xed k we will be implicitly assuming that\nwe are extracting the appropriate term from the partition function. The RR ground\nstates for the strings moving on M4 are the same as the ground states of a quantum\nmechanical supersymmetric sigma model on M4. It was shown by Witten [478] that\n164\n\n\nthese are in one-to-one correspondence with the harmonic forms on M4. Let us denote\nby hrs the number of harmonic forms of holomorphic degree r and antiholomorphic\ndegree s. States with degree r + s odd are fermionic, and states with r + s even are\nbosonic. In the case of K3 h00 = h22 = h20 = h02 = 1 and h11 = 20. In the case of\nT 4 h00 = h22 = h20 = h02 = 1, h01 = h10 = h12 = h21 = 2, and h11 = 4. A form with\ndegrees (r, s) gives rise to a state with angular momenta (j,\u02dcj) = ((r \u22121)/2, (s \u22121)/2).\nThe partition function in the RR sector becomes [466]\nX\nk\u22650\npkTrSym(M4)k[(\u22121)2J+2 \u00afJyJ \u00afy\n\u00afJ] =\n1\nQ\nn\u22651\nQ\nr,s(1 \u2212pny(r\u22121)/2\u00afy(s\u22121)/2)(\u22121)r+shrs , (5.21)\nwhere the trace is over the ground states of the RR sector. Spectral \ufb02ow boils down\nto the replacement p \u2192py1/2\u00afy1/2. Thus, we get the NS-NS partition function, giving\na prediction for the chiral primaries,\nX\nk\npkTrSym(M4)k[(\u22121)2J+2 \u00afJyJ \u00afy\n\u00afJ] =\n1\nQ\nn\u22650\nQ\nr,s(1 \u2212pn+1y(n+r)/2\u00afy(n+s)/2)(\u22121)r+shrs ,\n(5.22)\nwhere here the trace is over the chiral-chiral primaries in the NS-NS sector.\nNow, we should compare this with supergravity. In supergravity we start by cal-\nculating the spectrum of single particle chiral-chiral primaries. We then calculate the\nfull spectrum by considering multiparticle states. Each single particle state contributes\nwith a factor (1 \u2212yj\u00afy\u00afj)\u2212d(j,\u00afj) to the partition function, were d(j,\u00afj) is the total number\nof single particle states with these spins. The supergravity spectrum was calculated in\n[278, 479, 480, 447]. The number of single particle states is given by\nX\nj,\u00afj\nd(j,\u00afj)yj\u00afy\n\u00afj =\nX\nn,r,s\u22650\nhrsy\nn+r\n2 \u00afy\nn+s\n2 \u22121.\n(5.23)\nWe have excluded the identity, which is not represented by any state in supergravity.\nSo, the gravity partition function is given by\nTrSugra[(\u22121)2J+2 \u00afJyJ \u00afy\n\u00afJ]c\u2212c primaries =\n1\nQ\nn\u22650\nQ\u2032\nr,s(1 \u2212y(n+r)/2\u00afy(n+s)/2)(\u22121)r+shrs ,\n(5.24)\nwhere\nQ\u2032 means that we are not including the term with n = r = s = 0.\nLet us discuss some the particles appearing in (5.23) and (5.24) more explicitly. Some\nof them are special because they carry only left moving quantum numbers or only right\nmoving quantum numbers. For example, we have the (0, 1) and (1, 0) states that are\nrelated to the SU(2)L and SU(2)R gauge \ufb01elds on AdS3. These SU(2) symmetries\ncome from the SO(4) isometries of the 3-sphere. These gauge \ufb01elds have a Chern-\nSimons action [481, 138] and they give rise to SU(2) current algebras on the boundary\n[25, 154]. The chiral primary in the current algebra is the operator J+\n\u22121, which has\n165\n\n\nthe quantum numbers mentioned above.\nWhen we apply Q\u2212\u2212\n\u22121/2Q\u2212+\n\u22121/2 to this state\nwe get the left moving stress tensor. Again, this should correspond to part of the\nphysical modes of gravity on AdS3. Pure gravity in three dimensions is a theory with\nno local degrees of freedom. In fact, it is equivalent to an SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) Chern-\nSimons theory [481, 482, 483, 484]. This gives rise to some physical degrees of freedom\nliving at the boundary. It was argued that we get a Liouville theory at the boundary\n[485, 486, 487, 488, 489], which includes a stress tensor operator. In the T 4 case we\nalso have some other special particles which correspond to fermion zero modes (1/2, 0)\nand (0, 1/2). These fermion zero modes are the supersymmetric partners of the U(1)\ncurrents associated to isometries of T 4. The six dimensional theory corresponding to\ntype IIB string theory on T 4 has 16 vector \ufb01elds transforming in the spinor of SO(5, 5).\nFrom the symmetric product we get only 8 currents (4L + 4R). The other eight are\npresumably related to an extra copy of T 4 appearing in the CFT due to the Wilson\nlines of the U(1) in U(Q5) [460, 490].\nBesides these purely left-moving or purely right-moving modes, which are not so easy\nto see in supergravity, all other states arise as local bulk excitations of supergravity\n\ufb01elds on AdS3 and are clearly present.\nHigher values of j typically correspond to\nhigher Kaluza-Klein modes of lower j \ufb01elds.\nMore precisely, we have n (1/2, 1/2)\nstates where n = h11 + 1 [278, 479, 447]. By applying Q\u2019s, each of these states gives\nrise to four SU(2)-neutral scalar \ufb01elds, which have conformal weights h = \u00afh = 1.\nTherefore, they correspond to massless \ufb01elds in spacetime by (3.14). These are the 4n\nmoduli of the supergravity compacti\ufb01cation, which are identi\ufb01ed with the moduli of\nthe conformal \ufb01eld theory. In the conformal \ufb01eld theory 4h11 of them correspond to\ndeformations of each copy of M4 in the symmetric product, while the extra four are\nassociated to a blowup mode, the blowup mode of the Z2 singularity that arises when\nwe exchange two copies of M4. Next, we have n + 1 \ufb01elds with quantum numbers\n(1, 1), n of these are higher order Kaluza Klein modes of the n \ufb01elds we had before,\nand the new one corresponds to deformations of the S3. Each of these states gives rise\nto SU(2)-neutral \ufb01elds with positive mass, since we have to apply Q\u2019s twice and we get\nh = \u00afh = 2. These are the n \ufb01xed scalars of the supergravity background plus one more\n\ufb01eld related to changing the size of the S3. The \ufb01elds with j,\u00afj\u2019s above these values\nare just higher Kaluza Klein modes of the \ufb01elds we have already mentioned explicitly.\nSee [278, 479, 447] for a more systematic treatment and derivation of these results.\nNow, we want to compare the supergravity result with the gauge theory results.\nIn (5.22) there is an \u201cexclusion principle\u201d since the total power of p has to be pk,\nthus limiting the total number of particles. In supergravity (5.24) we do not have any\nindication of this exclusion principle. Even if we did not know about the conformal\n\ufb01eld theory, from the fact that there is an N = 4 superconformal spacetime symmetry\nwe get a bound on the angular momentum of the chiral primaries j \u2264k. However, this\n166\n\n\nbound is less restrictive than implied by (5.22). There are multi-particle states with\nj < k that are excluded from (5.22). The bounds from (5.22) appear for very large\nangular momenta and, therefore, very large energies, where we would not necessarily\ntrust the gravity approximation. In fact, the gravity result and the conformal \ufb01eld\ntheory result match precisely, as long as the conformal weight or spin of the chiral\nprimaries is j,\u00afj \u2264k/2. One can show that the gravity description exactly matches\nthe k \u2192\u221elimit of (5.22) [447]. This limit is extracted from (5.22) by noticing that\nthere is a factor of (1\u2212p) in the denominator, which is related to the identity operator.\nSo, we can extract the k \u2192\u221elimit by multiplying (5.22) by (1 \u2212p) and setting\np \u21921.\nIn principle, we could get precise agreement between the conformal \ufb01eld\ntheory calculation and the supergravity calculation if we incorporate the exclusion\nprinciple by assigning a \u201cdegree\u201d to each supergravity \ufb01eld, as explained in [476],\nand then considering only multiparticle states with degree smaller than k. One can\nfurther wonder whether there is something special that happens at j = k/2, when the\nexclusion principle starts making a di\ufb00erence. Since we are considering states with\nhigh conformal weight and angular momentum it is natural to wonder whether there\nare any black hole states that could appear. There are black holes which carry angular\nmomentum on S3. These black holes are characterized by the two angular momenta\nJL, JR, of SU(2)L\u00d7SU(2)R. The minimum black hole mass for given angular momenta\nwas given in (5.17), Mmin(JL, JR) = k/2 + J2\nL/k + J2\nR/k, where we used c = 6k and\n(5.4). We see that these masses are always bigger than the mass of the chiral primary\nstates with angular momenta (JL, JR), except when JL = JR = k/2. So we see that\nsomething special is happening at j = k/2, since at this point a black hole appears\nas a chiral primary state. Connections between this exclusion principle and quantum\ngroups and non-commutative geometry were studied in [491, 492].\n5.3.4\nCalculation of the Elliptic Genus in Supergravity\nWe could now consider states which are left moving chiral primaries and anything on\nthe right moving side. These states are also in small representations, and one might\nbe tempted to compute the spectrum of chiral primaries at the orbifold point and then\ntry to match it to supergravity. However, this is not the correct thing to do, and in\nfact the spectrum does not match [493]. It is not correct because some chiral primary\nstates could pair up and become very massive non-chiral primaries. In the case of\nchiral-anything states, a useful tool to count the number of states, which gives a result\nthat is independent of the deformations of the theory, is the \u201celliptic genus\u201d, which is\nthe partition function\nZk = TrRR[(\u22121)2j+2\u00afjqL0\u00afq\n\u00afL0yj].\n(5.25)\n167\n\n\nThis receives contributions only from the left moving ground states, \u00afL0 = 0. These\nstates map into (chiral, anything) under spectral \ufb02ow, i.e. states that are chiral pri-\nmaries on the left moving side but are unrestricted on the right moving side.\nThe number of states contributing to the elliptic genus goes like e2\u03c0\n\u221a\nnk for large\npowers qn. This raised some doubts that (5.25) would agree with supergravity. The\nelliptic genus diverges when we take the limit k \u2192\u221e. The origin of this divergence is\nthe contribution of the (2, 0) form, which is a chiral primary on the left but it carries\nzero conformal weight on the right. So, we get a contribution of order k from the fact\nthat this state could be occupied k times without changing the powers of q or y. The\nfunction that has a smooth limit in the k \u2192\u221elimit is then ZNS\nk\n/k. In the K3 case\nthis function is\nlim\nk\u2192\u221e\nZNS\nk\nk\n=\nQ\nm\u22651(1 \u2212qm/2y1/2)2(1 \u2212qm/2y\u22121/2)2(1 \u2212qm/2)20\nQ\nm\u22651(1 \u2212qm/2ym/2)24(1 \u2212qm/2y\u2212m/2)24\n.\n(5.26)\nWe can now compare this expression to the supergravity result. In the supergravity\nresult we explicitly exclude the contribution of the (2, 0) form, since it is directly related\nto the factor of k that we extracted, but we keep the contribution of the (0, 2) form and\nthe rest of the \ufb01elds. The supergravity result then agrees precisely with (5.26) [476].\nBoth in the supergravity calculation and in the conformal \ufb01eld theory calculation at\nthe orbifold point there are many \ufb01elds of the form (chiral,anything), but most of\nthem cancel out to give (5.26). For example, we can see that the only supergravity\nsingle particle states that contribute for large powers of y>1/2 are the (chiral, chiral)\nand (chiral, antichiral) states. One can further incorporate the exclusion principle in\nsupergravity by assigning degrees to the various \ufb01elds, and then one \ufb01nds that the\nelliptic genus agrees up to powers of qh with h \u2264(k + 1)/4 [476]. Here again this is\nthe point where a black hole starts contributing to the elliptic genus. It is an extremal\nrotating black hole with angular momentum JL = k/2 and JR = 0, which has L0 = k/4\nand \u00afL0 = k/2.\n5.4\nOther AdS3 Compacti\ufb01cations\nWe start by discussing the compacti\ufb01cations discussed in the last section more broadly,\nand then we will discuss other AdS3 compacti\ufb01cations. In the previous section we\nstarted out with type IIB string theory compacti\ufb01ed on M4 to six dimensions. The\ntheory has many charges carried by string like objects, which come from branes wrap-\nping on various cycles of M4. These charges transform as vectors under the duality\ngroup of the theory SO(5, n), where n = 21, 5 for the K3 and T 4 cases respectively.\nThese 5 + n strings correspond to the fundamental and D strings, the NS and D \ufb01ve-\nbranes wrapped on M4, and to D3 branes wrapped on the n + 1 two-cycles of M4. A\n168\n\n\ngeneral charge con\ufb01guration is given by a vector qI transforming under SO(5, n). The\nradius of curvature of the gravity solution is proportional to q2, R4 \u223cq2, where we use\nthe SO(5, n) metric. In the K3 case q2 > 0 for supersymmetric con\ufb01gurations. The six\ndimensional space-time theory has 5n massless scalar \ufb01elds, which parameterize the\ncoset manifold SO(5, n)/SO(5) \u00d7 SO(n) [494]. When we choose a particular charge\nvector, with q2 > 0, we break the duality group to SO(4, n), and out of the original 5n\nmassless scalars n becomes massive and have values determined by the charges (and\nthe other scalars) [495]. The remaining 4n scalars are massless and represent moduli\nof the supergravity compacti\ufb01cation and, therefore, moduli of the dual conformal \ufb01eld\ntheory. Note that the conformal \ufb01eld theory involves the instanton moduli space, but\nhere the word \u201cmoduli\u201d refers to the parameters of the CFT, such as the shape of T 4,\netc.\nIf we start moving in this moduli space we sometimes \ufb01nd that the gravity solution\nis best described by doing duality transformations [457, 343]. One interesting region\nin moduli space is when the system is best described in terms of a system of NS\n\ufb01vebranes and fundamental strings. This is the S-dual version of the D1-D5 system\nthat we were considering above. In this NS background the radius of the S3 and of AdS3\nis R2 = Q5\u03b1\u2032, and it is independent of Q1. Actually, Q1 only enters through the six\ndimensional string coupling, which in this case is a \ufb01xed scalar g2\n6 = Q5/Q1. The volume\nof M4 is a free scalar in this case. The advantage of this background is that one can solve\nstring theory on it to all orders in \u03b1\u2032, since it is a WZW model, actually an SL(2, R) \u00d7\nSU(2) WZW model. String propagation in SL(2, R) WZW models were studied in\n[496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513,\n514, 515, 516]. Thus, in this case we can also consider states corresponding to massive\nstring modes, etc. We can also de\ufb01ne the spacetime Virasoro generators in the full\nstring theory, and check that they act on string states as they should [509, 510, 511]5. In\nthe string theory description the Virasoro symmetry appears directly in the formalism\nas a spacetime symmetry. One can also study D-branes in these AdS3 backgrounds\n[519]. Conditions for spacetime supersymmetry for string theory on SL(2, R) WZW\nbackgrounds were studied in [520, 521]. In the D1-D5 con\ufb01guration it is much harder\nto solve string theory, since RR backgrounds are involved. Classical actions for strings\non these backgrounds were written in [522, 523, 524]. However, a formulation of string\ntheory on these backgrounds was proposed in [525] (see also [526, 521, 527]).\nFor\nsome values of the moduli the CFT is singular. What this means is that we will have\na continuum of states in the cylinder picture. In the picture with NS charges this\nhappens, for example, when all RR B-\ufb01elds on M4 are zero. This continuum of states\ncomes from fundamental strings stretching close to the boundary of AdS3. These states\n5Con\ufb01gurations with NS \ufb02uxes that lead to AdS2d+1 spaces where studied in [517]. It has also\nbeen suggested [518] that (2,1) strings can describe AdS3 spaces.\n169\n\n\nhave \ufb01nite energy, even though they are long, due to the interaction with the constant\nthree form \ufb01eld strength, H = dBNS, on AdS3 [342, 343].\nA simple variation of the previous theme is to quotient (orbifold) the three-sphere by\na ZN \u2282SU(2)L. This preserves N = (4, 0) supersymmetry. This quotient changes the\ncentral charge of the theory by a factor of N through (5.4) (since the volume of the S3\nis smaller by a factor of N). It is also possible to obtain this geometry by considering\nthe near horizon behavior of a D1-D5 + KK monopole system, or equivalently a D1-D5\nsystem near an AN singularity. It is possible to analyze the \ufb01eld theory by using the\nmethods in [344], and using the above anomaly argument one can calculate the right\nmoving central charge. The left moving central charge should be calculated by a more\ndetailed argument. When we have NS 5 branes and fundamental strings on an AN\nsingularity, the worldsheet theory is solvable, and one can calculate the spectrum of\nmassive string states, etc. [528]. One can also consider also both RR and NS \ufb02uxes\nsimultaneously [529]. Other papers analyzing aspects of these quotients or orbifolds\nare [530, 530, 531, 532, 533].\nA related con\ufb01guration arises if we consider M-theory on M6, where M6 = T 6, T 2 \u00d7\nK3 or CY3, and we wrap M5 branes on a four-cycle in M6 with non-vanishing triple\nself-intersection number. Then, we get a string in \ufb01ve dimensions, and the near horizon\ngeometry of the supergravity solution is AdS3 \u00d7 S2 \u00d7 M6\nf , where the subscript on M6\nf\nindicates that the vector moduli of M6 are \ufb01xed scalars. In this case we get again\nan N = (0, 4) theory, and the SU(2)R symmetry is associated to rotations of the\nsphere. It is possible to calculate the central charge by counting the number of moduli\nof the brane con\ufb01guration. Some of the moduli correspond to geometric deformations\nand some of them correspond to B-\ufb01elds on the \ufb01vebrane worldvolume [534, 535]. A\nsupergravity analysis of this compacti\ufb01cation was done in [447, 536].\nAnother interesting case is string theory compacti\ufb01ed on AdS3 \u00d7S3 \u00d7S3 \u00d7S1, which\nhas a large N = 4 symmetry [537, 538, 539]. This algebra is sometimes called A\u03b3. It\nincludes an SU(2)k \u00d7 SU(2)k\u2032 \u00d7 U(1) current algebra. The relative sizes of the levels\nof the two SU(2) factors are related to the relative sizes of the radii of the spheres.\nThis case seems to be conceptually simpler than the case with an M4, since all the\nspacetime dimensions are associated to a symmetry of the system6. In [537] a geometry\nlike this was obtained from branes, except that the S1 was replaced by R, and it is not\nclear which brane con\ufb01guration gives the geometry with the S1. This makes it more\ndi\ufb03cult to guess the dual conformal \ufb01eld theory. In [538] a CFT dual was proposed\nfor this system in the case that k = k\u2032. One starts with a theory with a free boson and\nfour free fermions, which has large N = 4 symmetry. Let us call this theory CFT3.\nThen, we can consider the theory based on the symmetric product Sym(CFT3)k. The\n6In the case of T 4 one can show that the U(1)4 symmetries of the torus can be viewed as the\nk\u2032 \u2192\u221elimit of the large N = 4 algebra [460].\n170\n\n\nspace-time theory has two moduli, which are the radius of the circle and the value of\nthe RR scalar. These translate into the radius of the compact U(1)-boson in CFT3\nand a blow up mode of the orbifold. In [539] a dual CFT was proposed for the general\ncase (k \u0338= k\u2032).\nAnother interesting example is the D1-D5 brane system in Type I string theory\n[540, 541, 542]. The N = (0, 4) theory on the D1 brane worldvolume theory encodes\nin the Yukawa couplings the ADHM data for the construction of the moduli space of\ninstantons [543, 544]. What distinguishes the Type I system from the Type IIB case is\nthe SO(32) gauge group in the open string sector. When the D5 branes wrap a compact\nspace M4 with M4 = T 4, K3, the near horizon geometry of the Type I supergravity\nsolution is AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7M4 [542]. As in the previous examples, one is lead to conjecture\na duality between Type I string theory on AdS3 \u00d7 S3 \u00d7 M4 and the two-dimensional\n(0, 4) SCFT in the IR limit of the D1 brane worldvolume theory. The supergroup of\nthe Type I compacti\ufb01cation is SU(1, 1|2) \u00d7 SL(2, R) \u00d7 SU(2), and the Kaluza-Klein\nspectrum in the supergravity can be analyzed as in [447]. The correspondence to the\ntwo-dimensional SCFT has not been much explored yet.\nThe relation between AdS3 compacti\ufb01cations and matrix theory [26] was addressed\nin [545].\n5.5\nPure Gravity\nOne might suspect that the simplest theory we could have on AdS3 is pure Einstein\ngravity. In higher dimensions this is not possible since pure gravity is not renormal-\nizable, so the only known sensible quantum gravity theory is string theory, but in\nthree dimensions gravity can be rewritten as a Chern-Simons theory [483, 484], and\nthis theory is renormalizable. Gravity in three dimensions has no dynamical degrees\nof freedom.\nWe have seen, nevertheless, that it has black hole solutions when we\nconsider gravity with a negative cosmological constant [442] (5.8). So, it should at\nleast describe the dynamics of these black holes, black hole collisions, etc. It has been\nargued that this Chern-Simons theory reduces to a Liouville theory at the boundary\n[485, 487, 488, 546], with the right central charge (5.4). Naively, using the Cardy for-\nmula, this Liouville theory does not seem to give the same entropy as the black holes,\nbut the Cardy formula does not hold in this case (Liouville theory does not satisfy the\nassumptions that go into the Cardy formula). Hopefully, these problems will be solved\nonce it is understood how to properly quantize Liouville theory. Since we have the\nright central charge it seems that we should be able to calculate the BTZ black hole\nentropy [446], but Liouville theory is very peculiar and the entropy seems smaller [547].\nOther papers studying AdS pure gravity or BTZ black holes in pure gravity include\n[548, 286, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564,\n171\n\n\n565, 566, 567].\nThe Chern-Simons approach to gravity has also led to a proposal for a black hole\nentropy counting in this pure gravity theory. In that approach the black hole entropy\nis supposed to come from degrees of freedom in the Chern-Simons theory that become\ndynamical when a horizon is present [568].\nOne interesting question in three dimensional gravity is whether we should consider\nthe Chern-Simons theory on a \ufb01xed topology or whether we should sum over topologies.\nNaively it is the second possibility, however it could be that the sum over topologies is\nalready included in the Chern-Simons path integral over a \ufb01xed topology.\nIn any case, three dimensional pure gravity is part of the full string theory compact-\ni\ufb01cations, and it would be interesting to understand it better.\nThe situation is similar if one studies pure AdS3 supergravities [138, 486, 569].\n5.6\nGreybody Factors\nIn this section we consider an extremal or near extremal black string in six dimensions.\nWe take the direction along the string to be compact, with radius R5 \u226bls. We need\nto take it to be compact since classically an in\ufb01nite black string is unstable [570, 571]7.\nHere we assume that the temperature is small enough so that the con\ufb01guration is clas-\nsically stable8. We take a con\ufb01guration with D1 brane charge Q1 and D5 brane charge\nQ5. The general solution with these charges, and arbitrary energy and momentum\nalong the string, has the following six dimensional Einstein metric9 [471, 572] :\nds2\nE =\n \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b1\nr2\n!\u22121/2  \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b3\nr2\n!\u22121/2 h\n\u2212dt2 + dx2\n5\n+ r2\n0\nr2(cosh \u03c3dt + sinh \u03c3dx5)2 +\n \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b1\nr2\n!\nds2\nM4\n#\n+\n \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b1\nr2\n!1/2  \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b3\nr2\n!1/2 \uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n \n1 \u2212r2\n0\nr2\n!\u22121\ndr2 + r2d\u21262\n3\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb.\n(5.27)\nWe consider the case that the internal space M4 = T 4. In general we will also have\nsome scalars that are non-constant. These become \ufb01xed scalars in the near-horizon\n7It might seem that we can avoid the instability of [570, 571] by going very near extremality. Note,\nhowever, that for an in\ufb01nite string it is entropically favorable to create a Schwarzschild black hole\nthreaded by an extremal string.\n8A general supergravity analysis of the various regimes in the D1-D5 system was given in [288].\n9Throughout this section we use the six dimensional Einstein metric, related to the six dimensional\nstring metric by gE = e\u2212\u03c66gstr, where \u03c66 is the six dimensional dilaton.\n172\n\n\nAdS3 limit. In this case there are \ufb01ve \ufb01xed scalars, which are three self-dual NS B-\n\ufb01elds, a combination of the RR scalar and the four-form on T 4, and \ufb01nally the volume\nof T 4. If we take the \ufb01rst four to zero at in\ufb01nity they stay zero throughout the solution.\nThen, the physical volume of T 4 is\n\u03bd(r) \u2261Volume\n(2\u03c0)4\u03b1\u20322 = v\n \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b3\nr2\n!\u22121  \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b1\nr2\n!\n,\n(5.28)\nwhere v = \u03bd(\u221e) is the value of the dimensionless volume at in\ufb01nity. The solution\n(5.27) is parameterized by the four independent quantities \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c3, r0. There are two\nextra parameters which enter through the charge quantization conditions, which are\nthe radius of the x5 dimension R5 and the volume v of T 4. The three charges are\nQ1 =\n1\n4\u03c02\u03b1\u2032\u221av\nZ\n\u03bd \u2217H\u2032 =\n\u221avr2\n0\n2\u03b1\u2032 sinh 2\u03b1,\nQ5 =\n1\n4\u03c02\u221av\u03b1\u2032\nZ\nH\u2032 =\nr2\n0\n2\u221av\u03b1\u2032 sinh 2\u03b3,\nN = R2r2\n0\n2\u03b1\u20322 sinh 2\u03c3,\n(5.29)\nwhere \u2217is the Hodge dual in the six dimensions x0, .., x5 and H\u2032 is the RR 3-form \ufb01eld.\nThe last charge N is related to the momentum around the S1 by P5 = N/R5. All three\ncharges are normalized to be integers.\nThe ADM energy of this solution is\nM = R5r2\n0\n2\u03b1\u20322 (cosh 2\u03b1 + cosh 2\u03b3 + cosh 2\u03c3) .\n(5.30)\nThe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is\nS =\nA10\n4G(10)\nN\n=\nA6\n4G(6)\nN\n= 2\u03c0R5r3\n0\n\u03b1\u20322\ncosh \u03b1 cosh \u03b3 cosh \u03c3,\n(5.31)\nwhere A is the area of the horizon and we have used the fact that in the six dimensional\nEinstein metric G(6),E\nN\n= \u03b1\u20322\u03c02/2. The Hawking temperature is\nT =\n1\n2\u03c0r0 cosh \u03b1 cosh \u03b3 cosh \u03c3.\n(5.32)\nThe near extremal black string corresponds to the case that R5 is large and the total\nmass is just above the rest energy of the branes. By \u201crest energy\u201d of the branes we\nmean the mass given by the BPS bound,\nE = M \u2212Q5R5\n\u221av \u2212Q1R5\n\u221av .\n(5.33)\n173\n\n\nNote that this includes the mass due to the excitations carrying momentum along the\ncircle. In the limit that \u03b1\u2032 \u21920 with E, R5 and N \ufb01xed we automatically go into the\nregime described by the conformal \ufb01eld theory living on the D1-D5 system which is\ndecoupled. Instead, we are going to take here \u03b1\u2032 small but nonzero, so that we keep\nsome coupling of the CFT to the rest of the degrees of freedom. The geometry is AdS3\n(locally) close to the horizon, but far away it is just the \ufb02at six dimensional space\nR1,4 \u00d7 S1. In this limit we can approximate the six dimensional geometry by\nds2\nE = f \u22121/2\n\"\n\u2212dt2 + dx2\n5 + r2\n0\nr2(cosh \u03c3dt + sinh \u03c3dx5)2\n#\n+ f 1/2(dr2 + r2d\u21262\n3),\n(5.34)\nwhere\nf =\n \n1 + r2\n1\nr2\n!  \n1 + r2\n5\nr2\n!\n,\nr2\n5 = \u03b1\u2032Q5\n\u221av ,\nr2\n1 = \u03b1\u2032Q1/\u221av.\n(5.35)\nLet us consider a minimally coupled scalar \ufb01eld, \u03c6, i.e. a scalar \ufb01eld that is not a\n\ufb01xed scalar. Let us send a quantum of that \ufb01eld to the black string, and calculate\nthe absorption cross section for low energies. This calculation was already discussed in\nsection 1.3.3, but for the reader\u2019s convenience we resummarize the computations here.\nThe low-energy condition is\n\u03c9 \u226a1/r5, 1/r1.\n(5.36)\nWe will consider here just an s-wave con\ufb01guration. We also set the momentum in the\ndirection of the string of the incoming particle to zero, the general case can be found\nin [18, 573]. Separation of variables, \u03c6 = e\u2212i\u03c9t\u03c7(r), leads to the radial equation\n\" h\nr3\u2202rhr3\u2202r + \u03c92f\n#\n\u03c7 = 0 ,\nh = 1 \u2212r2\n0\nr2.\n(5.37)\nClose to the horizon, a convenient radial variable is z = h = 1 \u2212r2\n0/r2. The matching\nprocedure can be summarized as follows:\nfar region:\n\u0014 1\nr3\u2202rr3\u2202r + \u03c92\n\u0015\n\u03c7 = 0,\n\u03c7 = AJ1(\u03c9r)\nr3/2\n,\nnear region:\n\"\nz(1 \u2212z)\u22022\nz +\n\u0012\n1 \u2212i\n\u03c9\n2\u03c0TH\n\u0013\n(1 \u2212z)\u2202z +\n\u03c92\n16\u03c02TLTR\n#\nz\ni\u03c9\n4\u03c0TH \u03c7 = 0,\n\u03c7 = z\n\u2212\ni\u03c9\n4\u03c0TH F\n\u0012\n\u2212i\n\u03c9\n4\u03c0TL\n, \u2212i\n\u03c9\n4\u03c0TR\n; 1 \u2212i\n\u03c9\n2\u03c0TH\n; z\n\u0013\n,\n(5.38)\nwhere TL, TR are de\ufb01ned in terms of the Hawking temperature TH and the chemical\npotential, \u00b5, which is conjugate to momentum on S1 :\n1\nTL,R\n\u22611 \u00b1 \u00b5\nTH\n,\nTL,R = r0e\u00b1\u03c3\n2\u03c0r1r5\n.\n(5.39)\n174\n\n\nAfter matching the near and far regions together and comparing the infalling \ufb02ux at\nin\ufb01nity and at the horizon, one arrives at\n\u03c3abs = \u03c03r2\n1r2\n5\u03c9\ne\n\u03c9\nTH \u22121\n\u0010\ne\n\u03c9\n2TL \u22121\n\u0011 \u0010\ne\n\u03c9\n2TR \u22121\n\u0011 .\n(5.40)\nNotice that this has the right form to be interpreted as the creation of a pair of particles\nalong the string.\nAccording to the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence, we can replace the near horizon region\nby the conformal \ufb01eld theory. The \ufb01eld \u03c6 couples to some operator O in the conformal\n\ufb01eld theory [574] :\nSint =\nZ\ndtdx5O(t, x5)\u03c6(t, x5,\u20d70).\n(5.41)\nThen, the absorption cross section can be calculated by\n\u03c3 \u223c1\nNi\nX\ni\nX\nf\n\f\f\f\f\u27e8f|\nZ\ndtdx5O(t, x5)eik0t+ik5x5|i\u27e9\n\f\f\f\f\n2\n\u223c1\nNi\nX\ni\nZ\neik0t+ik5x5\u27e8i|O(t, x5)O\u2020(0, 0)|i\u27e9\n\u223c\nZ\neik0t+ik5x5\u27e8O(t, x5)O\u2020(0, 0)\u27e9\u03b2,\n(5.42)\nwhere we have summed over \ufb01nal states in the CFT and averaged over initial states.\nWe will calculate the numerical coe\ufb03cients later. The average over initial states is\nessentially an average over a thermal ensemble, since the number of states is very large\nso the microcanonical ensemble is the same as a thermal ensemble. So, the \ufb01nal result\nis that we have to compute the two point function of the corresponding operator over a\nthermal ensemble. This essentially translates into computing the correlation function\non the Euclidean cylinder, and the result is proportional to (5.40) [16, 575, 574]. This\nargument reproduces the functional dependence on \u03c9 of (5.40). For other \ufb01elds (non-\nminimally coupled) the functional dependence on \u03c9 is determined just in terms of the\nconformal weight of the associated operator.\nLet us emphasize that the matching procedure (5.38) is valid only in the low energy\nregime (5.36). In this regime the typical gravitational size of the con\ufb01guration, which\nis of order r5, is much smaller than the Compton wavelength of the particle. See \ufb01gure\n1.4. In fact, note that in the connecting region r \u223cr5 the function \u03c6 does not vary very\nmuch. Let us see this more explicitly. We see from (5.37) that we can approximate the\nequation by something like \u03c92r2\n5\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2032\u2032 = 0. From (5.36) we see that the variation of \u03c6\nis very small over this connecting region. Furthermore, since absorption will turn out\nto be small, we can approximate the value of \u03c6 at the origin by the value it has in \ufb02at\nspace. So, we can directly match the values of \u03c6 at the origin for a wave propagating\nin \ufb02at space with the value of \u03c6 near the boundary of AdS3.\n175\n\n\nIn order to match the numerical coe\ufb03cient we need to determine the numerical\ncoe\ufb03cient in the two-point function of the operator O. This can be done for minimally\ncoupled scalars using a non-renormalization theorem, as it was done for the case of\nabsorption of gravitons on a D3 brane. The argument is the following. We \ufb01rst notice\nthat the moduli space of minimally coupled scalars in supergravity is SO(4, 5)/SO(4)\u00d7\nSO(5). This is a homogeneous space with some metric, so the gravity Lagrangian in\nspacetime will include\nS =\n1\n2\u03ba2\n6\nZ\nd6xgab(\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6a\u2202\u03c6b.\n(5.43)\nThe \ufb01elds \u03c6a couple to operators Oa, and we are interested in computing\n\u27e8Oa(x)Ob(0)\u27e9= Gab\nx4 .\n(5.44)\nThe operators Oa are a basis of marginal deformations of the CFT, and Gab is the\nmetric on the moduli space of the CFT. Since the conformal \ufb01eld theory has N = (4, 4)\nsupersymmetry, this metric is highly constrained. In fact, it was shown in [576] that it\nis the homogeneous metric on SO(4, 5)/SO(4) \u00d7 SO(5) (up to global identi\ufb01cations).\nSince the CFT moduli space is the same as the supergravity moduli space, the two\nmetrics could di\ufb00er only by an overall numerical factor Gab = Dgab, where D is a\nnumber. In order to compute this number we can go to a point in moduli space where\nthe CFT is just the orbifold Sym(T 4)k. This point corresponds to having a single D5\nbrane and k = Q5Q1 D1 branes. We can also choose the string coupling to be arbitrarily\nsmall. For example, we can choose the scalar \u03c6 to be an o\ufb00-diagonal component of the\nmetric on T 4. The absorption cross section calculation then reduces to the one done in\n[16], which we now review. We take the metric on the four-torus to be gij = \u03b4ij + hij,\nwhere h is a small perturbation, and choose \u03c6 = h12. The bulk action for \u03c6 then\nreduces to\n1\n2\u03ba2\n6\nZ\nd6x1\n2(\u2202\u03c6)2.\n(5.45)\nThe coupling of h to the \ufb01elds on the D1 branes can be derived by expanding the\nBorn-Infeld action. The leading term is\nS =\n1\n2\u03c0gs\u03b1\u2032\nZ\ndtdx5\n\u00141\n2(\u2202Xi)2 + h12(\u03c4, \u03c3,\u20d7x = 0)\u2202X1\u2202X2 + fermions\n\u0015\n.\n(5.46)\nTo extract the cross-section we take R5 = \u221e, but the volume of the transverse space\n176\n\n\nV \ufb01nite, and we use the usual 2-d S-matrix formulas:\n1\n\u221a\n2\u03ba6\n\u03c6(t,\u20d7x) =\nX\n\u20d7k\nZ\ndk5\n(2\u03c0)\n1\n\u221a\nV 2k0\n\u0010\na12\nk eik\u00b7x + h.c.\n\u0011\n,\n1\n\u221a2\u03c0gs\u03b1\u2032Xi(t, x5) =\nZ dk5\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u221a\n2k0\n\u0010\nai\nkeik\u00b7x + h.c.\n\u0011\n,\n|\u02dci\u27e9= (a12\nk )\u2020|0\u27e9,\n| \u02dcf\u27e9= (a1\np)\u2020(a2\nq)\u2020|0\u27e9,\n\u27e8\u02dcf|Vint|\u02dci\u27e9=\n\u221a\n2\u03ba6p \u00b7 q\n\u221a\nV\n,\n\u0393(k0) =\n2Q1Q5\n2k02p02q0\nZ dp5\n2\u03c0\ndq5\n2\u03c0\n\f\f\f\u27e8\u02dcf|Vint|\u02dci\u27e9\n\f\f\f\n2 2\u03c0\u03b4(p5 + q5)2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212p0 \u2212q0),\n\u03c3abs = V \u0393(\u03c9) = \u03c03\u03b1\u20322Q1Q5\u03c9.\n(5.47)\nSince we have put the four transverse dimensions into a box of volume V , the \ufb02ux\nof the hij gravitons on the brane is F = 1/V . To \ufb01nd the cross-section we divide the\nnet decay rate by the \ufb02ux. The unusual factors of\n\u221a\n2\u03ba6 and 1/\u221a2\u03c0gs\u03b1\u2032 come from\nthe coe\ufb03cients of the kinetic terms for h12 and Xi (5.45)(5.46). The leading factor\nof 2 in the equation for \u0393(k0) in (5.47) is there because there are two distinguishable\n\ufb01nal states that can come out of a given h12 initial state: an X1 boson moving left\nand an X2 boson moving right, or X1 moving right and X2 moving left. The factor of\nQ1Q5 comes from the fact that we have Q1Q5 D1 branes. Note that the delta function\nconstraints plus the on shell conditions imply that p0 = q0 = p5 = \u2212q5 = \u03c9/2 and\np \u00b7 q = \u03c92/2.\nThe \ufb01nal answer in (5.47) agrees with the zero temperature limit of (5.40). As we\nremarked before, the thermal-looking factors in (5.40) can be derived just by doing a\ncalculation of the two point function on the cylinder [574]. Finally, we should remark\nthat this calculation implies that the metric on the moduli space of the CFT has\nan overall factor of k = Q1Q5 as compared with the metric that appears in the six\ndimensional gravity action (5.43). This blends in perfectly with the expectations from\nAdS3/CFT2, since in the AdS3 region, by the time we go down to three dimensions, we\nget factors of the volume of the S3 and the radius of AdS3 which produce the correct\nfactor of k in the gravity answer for the metric on the moduli space.\nOf course, this absorption cross section calculation is also related to the time reversed\nprocess of Hawking emission. Indeed, the Hawking radiation rates calculated in gravity\nand in the conformal \ufb01eld theory coincide.\nMany other greybody factors were calculated and compared with the \ufb01eld theory\npredictions [17, 573, 577, 578, 579, 574, 580, 66, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 73, 587,\n588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595]. In some of these references the \u201ce\ufb00ective string\u201d\nmodel is mentioned. This e\ufb00ective string model is essentially the conformal \ufb01eld theory\n177\n\n\nat the orbifold point Sym(T 4)k. Some of the gravity calculations did not agree with the\ne\ufb00ective string calculation. Typically that was because either the energies considered\nwere not low enough, or because one needed to take into account the e\ufb00ect of the\ndeformation in the CFT away from the symmetric product point in the moduli space.\n5.7\nBlack Holes in Five Dimensions\nIf we Kaluza-Klein reduce, using [596, 597], the metric (5.27) on the circle along the\nstring, we get a \ufb01ve dimensional charged black hole solution :\nds2\n5 = \u2212\u03bb\u22122/3\n \n1 \u2212r2\n0\nr2\n!\ndt2 + \u03bb1/3\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n \n1 \u2212r2\n0\nr2\n!\u22121\ndr2 + r2d\u21262\n3\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb,\n(5.48)\nwhere\n\u03bb =\n \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b1\nr2\n!  \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03b3\nr2\n!  \n1 + r2\n0sinh2\u03c3\nr2\n!\n.\n(5.49)\nThis is just the \ufb01ve-dimensional Schwarzschild metric, with the time and space com-\nponents rescaled by di\ufb00erent powers of \u03bb. The solution is manifestly invariant under\npermutations of the three boost parameters, as required by U-duality. The event hori-\nzon is clearly at r = r0. The coordinates we have used present the solution in a simple\nand symmetric form, but they do not always cover the entire spacetime. When all three\ncharges are nonzero, the surface r = 0 is a smooth inner horizon. This is analogous to\nthe situation in four dimensions with four charges [598, 599].\nThe mass, entropy and temperature of this solution are the same as those calculated\nabove for the black string (5.30)(5.31)(5.32). It is interesting to take the extremal limit\nr0 \u21920 with r0e\u03b3, r0e\u03b1, r0e\u03c3 \ufb01nite and nonzero. This is an extremal black hole solution\nin \ufb01ve dimensions with a non-singular horizon which has non-zero horizon area. The\nentropy becomes\nS = 2\u03c0\nq\nQ1Q5N,\n(5.50)\nwhich is independent of all the continuous parameters in the theory, and depends only\non the charges (5.29).\nWe can calculate this entropy as follows [13].\nThese black\nhole states saturate the BPS bound, so they are BPS states. Thus, we should \ufb01nd\nan \u201cindex\u201d, which is a quantity that is invariant under deformations and counts the\nnumber of BPS states. Such an index was computed in [13] for the case where the\ninternal space was M4 = K3 and in [460] for M4 = T 4. These indices are also called\nhelicity supertrace formulas [600]. Once we know that they do not receive contributions\nfrom non-BPS quantities, we can change the parameters of the theory and go to a point\nwhere we can do the calculation, for example, we can take R5 to be large and then go\nto the point where we have the Sym(M4)k description.\n178\n\n\nIt is interesting that we can also consider near extremal black holes, in the approx-\nimation that the contribution to the mass of two of the charges is much bigger than\nthe third and much bigger than the mass above extremality. This region in parameter\nspace is sometimes called the \u201cdilute gas\u201d regime. In the \ufb01ve dimensional context it\nis natural to take R5 \u223cls, and at \ufb01rst sight we would not expect the CFT description\nto be valid. Nevertheless, it is \u201cexperimentally\u201d observed that the absorption cross\nsection is still (5.40), since the calculation is exactly the same as the one we did above.\nThis suggests that the CFT description is also valid in this case. A qualitative expla-\nnation of this fact was given in [468], where it was observed that the the strings could\nbe multiply wound leading to a very low energy gap, much lower than 1/R5, and of\nthe right order of magnitude as expected for a 5d black hole.\nAlmost all that we said in this subsection can be extended to four dimensional black\nholes.\n179\n\n\nChapter 6\nOther AdS Spaces and\nNon-Conformal Theories\n6.1\nOther Branes\n6.1.1\nM5 Branes\nThere exist six dimensional N = (2, 0) SCFTs, which have sixteen supercharges, and\nare expected to be non-trivial isolated \ufb01xed points of the renormalization group in\nsix dimensions (see [93] and references therein). As a consequence, they have neither\ndimensionful nor dimensionless parameters. These theories have an Sp(2) \u2243SO(5)\nR-symmetry group.\nThe AN\u22121 (2, 0) theory is realized as the low-energy theory on the worldvolume of\nN coincident M5 branes (\ufb01ve branes of M theory). The N = (2, 0) supersymmetry\nalgebra includes four real spinors of the same chirality, in the 4 of SO(5). Its only\nirreducible massless matter representation consists of a 2-form B\u00b5\u03bd with a self-dual\n\ufb01eld strength, \ufb01ve real scalars and fermions. It is called a tensor multiplet. For a\nsingle 5-brane the \ufb01ve real scalars in the tensor multiplet de\ufb01ne the embedding of the\nM5 brane in eleven dimensions. The R-symmetry group is the rotation group in the\n\ufb01ve dimensions transverse to the M5 worldvolume, and it rotates the \ufb01ve scalars. The\nlow-energy theory on the moduli space of \ufb02at directions includes r tensor multiplets\n(where for the AN\u22121 theories r = N \u22121). The moduli space is parametrized by the\nscalars in the tensor multiplets. It has orbifold singularities (for the AN\u22121 theory it\nis R5(N\u22121)/SN) and the theory at the singularities is superconformal. The self-dual\n2-form B\u00b5\u03bd couples to self-dual strings. At generic points on the moduli space these\nstrings are BPS saturated, and at the superconformal point their tension goes to zero.\nThe AN\u22121 (2, 0) superconformal theory has a Matrix-like DLCQ description as quan-\ntum mechanics on the moduli space of AN\u22121 instantons [601]. In this description the\n180\n\n\nchiral primary operators are identi\ufb01ed with the cohomology with compact support of\nthe resolved moduli space of instantons, which is localized at the origin [602]. Their\nlowest components are scalars in the symmetric traceless representations of the SO(5)\nR-symmetry group.\nThe eleven dimensional supergravity metric describing N M5 branes is given by1\nds2\n=\nf \u22121/3(\u2212dt2 +\n5\nX\ni=1\ndx2\ni ) + f 2/3(dr2 + r2d\u21262\n4) ,\nf\n=\n1 + \u03c0Nl3\np\nr3\n,\n(6.1)\nand there is a 4-form \ufb02ux of N units on the S4.\nThe near horizon geometry of (6.1) is of the form AdS7 \u00d7 S4 with the radii of\ncurvature RAdS = 2RS4 = 2lp(\u03c0N)1/3. Note that since RAdS \u0338= RS4 this background\nis not conformally \ufb02at, unlike the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background discussed above. Following\nsimilar arguments to those of section 3.1 leads to the conjecture that the AN\u22121 (2, 0)\nSCFT is dual to M theory on AdS7 \u00d7 S4 with N units of 4-form \ufb02ux on S4 [5].\nThe eleven dimensional supergravity description is applicable for large N, since then\nthe curvature is small in Planck units. Corrections to supergravity will go like positive\npowers of lp/RAdS \u223cN\u22121/3; the supergravity action itself is of order M9\np \u223cN3 (instead\nof N2 in the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 case). The known corrections in M theory are all positive\npowers of l3\np \u223c1/N, suggesting that the (2, 0) theories have a 1/N expansion at large\nN. The bosonic symmetry of the supergravity compacti\ufb01cation is SO(6, 2) \u00d7 SO(5).\nThe SO(6, 2) part is the conformal group of the SCFT, and the SO(5) part is its\nR-symmetry.\nThe Kaluza-Klein excitations of supergravity contain particles with spin less than\ntwo, so they fall into small representations of supersymmetry. Therefore, their masses\nare protected from quantum (M theory) corrections. As in the other examples of the\nduality, these excitations correspond to chiral primary operators of the AN\u22121 (2, 0)\nSCFT, whose scaling dimensions are protected from quantum corrections. The spec-\ntrum of Kaluza-Klein harmonics of supergravity on AdS7 \u00d7 S4 was computed in [603].\nThe lowest components of the SUSY multiplets are scalar \ufb01elds with\nm2R2\nAdS = 4k(k \u22123),\nk = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(6.2)\nThey fall into the k-th order symmetric traceless representation of SO(5) with unit\nmultiplicity. The k = 1 excitation is the singleton that can be gauged away except on\nthe boundary of AdS. It decouples from the other operators and can be identi\ufb01ed with\nthe free \u201ccenter of mass\u201d tensor multiplet on the \ufb01eld theory side.\n1Our conventions are such that the tension of the M2 brane is T2 = 1/(2\u03c0)2l3\np.\n181\n\n\nUsing the relation between the dimensions of the operators \u2206and the masses m of\nthe Kaluza-Klein excitations m2R2\nAdS = \u2206(\u2206\u22126), the dimensions of the corresponding\noperators in the SCFT are \u2206= 2k,\nk = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 [604, 605, 606, 607]. These are the\ndimensions of the chiral primary operators of the AN\u22121 (2, 0) theory as found from the\nDLCQ description2. The expectation values of these operators parametrize the space\nof \ufb02at directions of the theory, (R5)N\u22121/SN. The dimensions of these operators are the\nsame as the naive dimension of the product of k free tensor multiplets, though there is\nno good reason for this to be true (unlike the d = 4 N = 4 theory, where the dimension\nhad to be similar to the free \ufb01eld dimension for small \u03bb, and then for the chiral operators\nit could not change as we vary \u03bb). For large N, the k = 2 scalar \ufb01eld with \u2206= 4 is\nthe only relevant deformation of the SCFT and it breaks the supersymmetry. All the\nnon-chiral \ufb01elds appear to have large masses in the large N limit, implying that the\ncorresponding operators have large dimensions in the \ufb01eld theory.\nThe spectrum includes also a family of spin one Kaluza-Klein excitations that couple\nto 1-form operators of the SCFT. The massless vectors in this family couple to the\ndimension \ufb01ve R-symmetry currents of the SCFT. The massless graviton couples to\nthe stress-energy tensor of the SCFT. As in the d = 4 N = 4 case, the chiral \ufb01elds\ncorresponding to the di\ufb00erent towers of Kaluza-Klein harmonics are related to the\nscalar operators associated with the Kaluza-Klein tower (6.2) by the supersymmetry\nalgebra. For each value of (large enough) k, the SUSY multiplets include one \ufb01eld\nin each tower of Kaluza-Klein states. Its SO(5) representation is determined by the\nrepresentation of the scalar \ufb01eld.\nFor instance, the R-symmetry currents and the\nenergy-momentum tensor are in the same supersymmetry multiplet as the scalar \ufb01eld\ncorresponding to k = 2 in equation (6.2).\nAs we did for the D3 branes in section 4.1, we can place the M5 branes at singularities\nand obtain other dual models. If we place the M5 branes at the origin of R6 \u00d7 R5/\u0393\nwhere \u0393 is a discrete subgroup of the SO(5) R-symmetry group, we get AdS7 \u00d7 S4/\u0393\nas the near horizon geometry. With \u0393 \u2282SU(2) \u2282SO(5) which is an ADE group we\nobtain theories with (1, 0) supersymmetry. The analysis of these models parallels that\nof section 4.1.1. In particular, the matching of the \u0393-invariant supergravity Kaluza-\nKlein modes and the \ufb01eld theory operators has been discussed in [608].\nAnother example is the DN (2, 0) SCFT. It is realized as the low-energy theory on\nthe worldvolume of N M5 branes at an R5/Z2 orientifold singularity. The Z2 re\ufb02ects\nthe \ufb01ve coordinates transverse to the M5 branes and changes the sign of the 3-form\n\ufb01eld C of eleven dimensional supergravity. The near horizon geometry is the smooth\nspace AdS7 \u00d7 RP4 [604]. In the supergravity solution we identify the \ufb01elds at points\non the sphere with the \ufb01elds at antipodal points, with a change of the sign of the C\n2The DLCQ description corresponded to the theory including the free tensor multiplet, so it in-\ncluded also the k = 1 operator.\n182\n\n\n\ufb01eld. This identi\ufb01cation projects out half of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and only the\neven k harmonics remain. An additional chiral \ufb01eld arises from a M2 brane wrapped\non the 2-cycle in RP4, which is non-trivial due to the orientifolding; this is analogous\nto the Pfa\ufb03an of the SO(2N) d = 4 N = 4 SYM theories which is identi\ufb01ed with a\nwrapped 3-brane [216] (as discussed in section 4.1.2). The dimension of this operator\nis \u2206= 2N.\nTo leading order in 1/N the correlation functions of the other chiral\noperators are similar to those of the AN\u22121 SCFT. The DN theories also have a DLCQ\nMatrix description as quantum mechanics on the moduli space of DN instantons [601].\nThis moduli space is singular. One would expect to associate the spectrum of chiral\nprimary operators with the cohomology with compact support of some resolution of\nthis space, but such a resolution has not been constructed yet.\nA di\ufb00erent example is the (1, 0) six dimensional SCFT with E8 global symmetry,\nwhich is realized on the worldvolume of M5 branes placed on top of the nine brane in\nthe Ho\u02c7rava-Witten [609] compacti\ufb01cation of M theory on R10\u00d7S1/Z2. The conjectured\ndual description is in terms of M theory on AdS7 \u00d7 S4/Z2 [610]. The Z2 action has a\n\ufb01xed locus AdS7\u00d7S3 on which a ten dimensional N = 1 E8 vector multiplet propagates.\nThe chiral operators fall into short representations of the supergroup OSp(6, 2|2). In\n[611] E8 neutral and charged operators of the (1, 0) theory were matched with Kaluza-\nKlein modes of bulk \ufb01elds and \ufb01elds living on the singular locus, respectively.\nCorrelation functions of chiral primary operators of the large N (2, 0) theory can\nbe computed by solving classical di\ufb00erential equations for the supergravity \ufb01elds that\ncorrespond to the \ufb01eld theory operators. Two and three point functions of the chiral\nprimary operators have been computed in [612].\nThe (2, 0) SCFT has Wilson surface observables [613], which are generalizations\nof the operator given by W(\u03a3) = exp(i\nR\n\u03a3 B\u00b5\u03bdd\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd) in the theory of a free tensor\nmultiplet, where \u03a3 is a two dimensional surface. A prescription for computing the\nWilson surface in the dual M theory picture has been given in [294].\nIt amounts,\nin the supergravity approximation, to the computation of the minimal volume of a\nmembrane bounded at the boundary of AdS7 by \u03a3. The reasoning is analogous to that\ndiscussed in section 3.5, but here instead of the strings stretched between D-branes,\nM2 branes are stretched between M5 branes. Such an M2 brane behaves as a string on\nthe M5 branes worldvolume, with a tension proportional to the distance between the\nM5 branes. By separating one M5 brane from N M5 branes this string can be used\nas a probe of the SCFT on the worldvolume of the N M5 branes, analogous to the\nexternal quarks discussed in section 3.5. If we consider two such parallel strings with\nlength l and distance L and of opposite orientation, the resulting potential per unit\nlength is [294]\nV\nl = \u2212c N\nL2 ,\n(6.3)\n183\n\n\nwhere c is a positive numerical constant. The dependence on L is as expected from\nconformal invariance. The procedure for Wilson surface computations has been applied\nalso to the computation of the operator product expansion of Wilson surfaces, and the\nextraction of the OPE coe\ufb03cients of the chiral primary operators [612].\nThe six dimensional AN\u22121 theory can be wrapped on various two dimensional mani-\nfolds. At energies lower than the inverse size of the manifolds, the low-energy e\ufb00ective\ndescription is in terms of four dimensional SU(N) gauge theories. The two dimensional\nmanifold and its embedding in eleven dimensions determine the amount of supersym-\nmetry of the gauge theory. The simplest case is a wrapping on T 2 which preserves all the\nsupersymmetry. This results in the N = 4 SU(N) SCFT, with the complex gauge cou-\npling being the complex structure \u03c4 of the torus. In general, when the two dimensional\nmanifold is a holomorphic curve (Riemann surface), called a supersymmetric cycle, the\nfour dimensional theory is supersymmetric. For N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theo-\nries the Riemann surface is the Seiberg-Witten curve and its period matrix gives the\nlow energy holomorphic gauge couplings \u03c4ij (i, j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N \u22121) [614, 615, 616, 353].\nFor N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories the Riemann surface has genus zero and it\nencodes holomorphic properties of the supersymmetric gauge theory, namely the struc-\nture of its moduli space of vacua [617]. For a generic real two dimensional manifold\nthe four dimensional theory is not supersymmetric. Some qualitative properties of the\nQCD string [618] and the \u03b8 vacua follow from the wrapping procedure. Of course,\nin the non-supersymmetric cases the subtle issue of stability has to be addressed as\ndiscussed in section 4.1. In general it is not known how to compute the near-horizon\nlimit of 5-branes wrapped on a general manifold. At any rate, it seems that the theory\non M5 branes is very relevant to the study of four dimensional gauge theories. The\nM5 branes theory will be one starting point for an approach to studying pure QCD in\nsection 6.2.\nOther works on M5 branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence are [619,\n620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630].\n6.1.2\nM2 Branes\nN = 8 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions can be obtained by a di-\nmensional reduction of the four dimensional N = 4 gauge theory. The automorphism\ngroup of the N = 8 supersymmetry algebra is SO(8). The fermionic generators of the\nN = 8 supersymmetry algebra transform in the real two dimensional representation of\nthe SO(2, 1) Lorentz group, and in the 8s representation of the SO(8) automorphism\nalgebra. The massless matter representation of the algebra consists of eight bosons in\nthe 8v and eight fermions in the 8c of SO(8). Viewed as a dimensional reduction of\nthe vector multiplet of the four dimensional N = 4 theory which has six real scalars,\n184\n\n\none extra scalar is the component of the gauge \ufb01eld in the reduced dimension and the\nsecond extra scalar is the dual to the vector in three dimensions.\nAn N = 8 supersymmetric Yang-Mills Lagrangian does not posses the full SO(8)\nsymmetry. It is only invariant under an SO(7) subgroup. At long distances it is ex-\npected to \ufb02ow to a superconformal theory that exhibits the SO(8) R-symmetry (see\n[93] and references therein). The \ufb02ow will be discussed in the next section. This IR\nconformal theory is realized as the low-energy theory on the worldvolume of N overlap-\nping M2 branes. For a single M2 brane, the eight real scalars de\ufb01ne its embedding in\neleven dimensions. The R-symmetry group is the rotation group in the eight transverse\ndimensions to the M2 worldvolume, which rotates the eight scalars.\nThe eleven dimensional supergravity metric describing N M2 branes is given by\nds2\n=\nf \u22122/3(\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2) + f 1/3(dr2 + r2d\u21262\n7) ,\nf\n=\n1 + 32\u03c02Nl6\np\nr6\n,\n(6.4)\nand there are N units of \ufb02ux of the dual to the 4-form \ufb01eld on S7.\nThe near horizon geometry of (6.4) is of the form AdS4 \u00d7 S7 with the radii of\ncurvature 2RAdS = RS4 = lp(32\u03c02N)1/6. One conjectures that the three dimensional\nN = 8 SCFT on the worldvolume of N M2 branes is dual to M theory on AdS4 \u00d7 S7\nwith N units of \ufb02ux of the dual to the 4-form \ufb01eld on S7 [5].\nThe supergravity description is applicable for large N. Corrections to supergravity\nwill be proportional to positive powers of lp/RAdS \u223cN\u22121/6; the known corrections are\nall proportional to powers of l3\np \u223cN\u22121/2. The supergravity action itself is in this case\nproportional to M9\np \u223cN3/2, so this will be the leading behavior of all correlation func-\ntions in the large N limit. The bosonic symmetry of the supergravity compacti\ufb01cation\nis SO(3, 2) \u00d7 SO(8). As is standard by now, the SO(3, 2) part is identi\ufb01ed with the\nconformal group of the three dimensional SCFT, and the SO(8) part is its R-symmetry.\nThe fermionic symmetries may also be identi\ufb01ed. We can relate the chiral \ufb01elds of the\nSCFT with the Kaluza-Klein excitations of supergravity whose spectrum was analyzed\nin [631, 632].\nThe lowest component of the supersymmetry multiplets is a family of scalar excita-\ntions with\nm2R2\nAdS = 1\n4k(k \u22126),\nk = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(6.5)\nThey fall into the k-th order symmetric traceless representation of SO(8) with unit\nmultiplicity. The dimensions of the corresponding operators in the N = 8 SCFT are\n\u2206= k/2, k = 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 [604, 605, 607]. Their expectation values parametrize the space\nof \ufb02at directions of the theory, (R8)N\u22121/SN. When viewed as the IR limit of the three\ndimensional N = 8 Yang-Mills theory, some of these operators can be identi\ufb01ed as\n185\n\n\nTr(\u03c6I1...\u03c6Ik) where \u03c6I are the seven scalars of the vector multiplet. As noted above,\nthe eighth scalar arises upon dualizing the vector \ufb01eld, which we can perform explicitly\nonly in the abelian case. The other chiral \ufb01elds are all obtained by the action of the\nsupersymmetry generators on the \ufb01elds of (6.5).\nUnlike the (2, 0) SCFTs, the d = 3 N = 8 theories do not have a simple DLCQ\ndescription (see [633]), and the spectrum of their chiral operators is not known. The\nabove spectrum is the prediction of the conjectured duality, for large N.\nWe can place the M2 branes at singularities and obtain other dual models, as in sec-\ntion 4.1. If we place the M2 branes at the origin of R3\u00d7R8/\u0393 with \u0393 a discrete subgroup\nof the SO(8) R-symmetry group, we get AdS4\u00d7S7/\u0393 as the near horizon geometry. One\nclass of models is when \u0393 \u2282SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) is a cyclic group. It is generated by multiply-\ning the complex coordinates z1,2,3,4 of C4 \u2243R8 by diag(e2\u03c0i/k, e\u22122\u03c0i/k, e2\u03c0ia/k, e\u22122\u03c0ia/k)\nfor relatively prime integers a, k. When a = 1, k = 2 the near horizon geometry is\nAdS4 \u00d7 RP7 with a dual N = 8 theory, which is the IR limit of the SO(2N) gauge\ntheory [604]. As in section 4.1.2, one can add a discrete theta angle to get additional\ntheories [634, 635]. When a = \u00b11, k > 2 one gets N = 6 supersymmetry, while for\na \u0338= \u00b11 the supersymmetry is reduced to N = 4. Other models are obtained by non\ncyclic \u0393. As for the D3 branes [347] and the M5 branes [608], the \u0393-invariant super-\ngravity Kaluza-Klein modes and the \ufb01eld theory operators of some of these models\nhave been analyzed in [636].\nAnother class of models is obtained by putting the M2 branes at hypersurface sin-\ngularities de\ufb01ned by the complex equation\nx2 + y2 + z2 + v3 + w6k\u22121 = 0 ,\n(6.6)\nwhere k is an integer. The near horizon geometry is of the form AdS4 \u00d7 H, where H\nis topologically equivalent to S7 but in general not di\ufb00eomorphic to it. Some of these\nexamples, k = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 28, correspond to the known exotic seven-spheres. The expected\nsupersymmetry is at least N = 2 and may be N = 3, depending on whether the R-\nsymmetry group corresponding to the isometry group of the metric on the exotic seven\nspheres is SO(2) or SO(3). An example with N = 1 supersymmetry is when H is the\nsquashed seven sphere which is the homogeneous space (Sp(2)\u00d7Sp(1))/(Sp(1)\u00d7Sp(1)).\nIn this case the R-symmetry group is trivial (SO(1)).\nA general classi\ufb01cation of possible near horizon geometries of the form AdS4 \u00d7 H\nand related SCFTs in three dimensions is given in [333, 332]. Most of these SCFTs\nhave not been explored yet.\nOther works on M2 branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence are [637,\n638, 639, 640, 401, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 339, 646].\n186\n\n\n6.1.3\nDp Branes\nNext, we discuss the near-horizon limits of other Dp branes. They give spaces which\nare di\ufb00erent from AdS, corresponding to the fact that the low-energy \ufb01eld theories on\nthe Dp branes are not conformal.\nThe Dp branes of the type II string are charged under the Ramond-Ramond p + 1-\nform potential. Their tension is given by Tp \u22431/gslp+1\ns\nand is equal to their Ramond-\nRamond charge. They are BPS saturated objects preserving half of the 32 supercharges\nof Type II string theories. The low energy worldvolume theory of N \ufb02at coinciding Dp\nbranes is thus invariant under sixteen supercharges. It is the maximally supersymmetric\np + 1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory with U(N) gauge group. Its symmetry group is\nISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212p), where the \ufb01rst factor is the p + 1 dimensional Poincar\u00b4e group\nand the second factor is the R-symmetry group. The theory can be obtained as a\ndimensional reduction of N = 1 SYM in ten dimensions to p + 1 dimensions.\nIts\nbosonic \ufb01elds are the gauge \ufb01elds and 9 \u2212p scalars in the adjoint representation of the\ngauge group. The scalars parametrize the embedding of the Dp branes in the 9 \u2212p\ntransverse dimensions. The SO(9\u2212p) R-symmetry group is the rotation group in these\ndimensions, and the scalars transform in its vector representation. In the following we\nwill discuss the decoupling limit of the brane worldvolume theory from the bulk and\nthe regions of validity of di\ufb00erent descriptions.\nThe Yang-Mills gauge coupling in the Dp brane theory is given by\ng2\nY M = 2(2\u03c0)p\u22122gslp\u22123\ns\n.\n(6.7)\nThe decoupling from the bulk (\ufb01eld theory) limit is the limit ls \u21920 where we keep the\nYang-Mills coupling constant and the energies \ufb01xed. For p \u22643 this implies that the\ntheory decouples from the bulk and that the higher gs and \u03b1\u2032 corrections to the Dp\nbrane action are suppressed. For p > 3, as seen from (6.7), the string coupling goes to\nin\ufb01nity and we need to use a dual description to analyze this issue.\nLet u \u2261r/\u03b1\u2032 be a \ufb01xed expectation value of a scalar. At an energy scale u, the\ndimensionless e\ufb00ective coupling constant of the Yang-Mills theory is\ng2\neff \u223cg2\nY MNup\u22123 .\n(6.8)\nThe perturbative Yang-Mills description is applicable when g2\neff \u226a1.\nThe ten dimensional supergravity background describing N Dp branes is given by\nthe string frame metric\nds2\n=\nf \u22121/2(\u2212dt2 +\np\nX\ni=1\ndx2\ni ) + f 1/2\n9\nX\ni=p+1\ndx2\ni ,\nf\n=\n1 + cpg2\nY MN\nl4su7\u2212p\n,\n(6.9)\n187\n\n\nwith a constant cp = 26\u22122p\u03c0(9\u22123p)/2\u0393((7 \u2212p)/2).\nThe background has a Ramond-\nRamond p + 1-form potential A0...p = (1 \u2212f \u22121)/2, and a dilaton\ne\u22122(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6\u221e) = f (p\u22123)/2 .\n(6.10)\nAfter a variable rede\ufb01nition\nz =\n2\nq\ncpg2\nY MN\n(5 \u2212p)u\n5\u2212p\n2 ,\n(6.11)\nthe \ufb01eld theory limit of the metric (6.9) for p < 5 takes the form [647, 648]\nds2 = \u03b1\u2032\n \n2\n5 \u2212p\n! 7\u2212p\n5\u2212p \u0010\ncpg2\nY MN\n\u0011\n1\n5\u2212p z\n3\u2212p\n5\u2212p\n(\u2212dt2 + d\u20d7x2 + dz2\nz2\n+ (5 \u2212p)2\n4\nd\u21262\n8\u2212p\n)\n,\n(6.12)\nwith the dilaton\ne\u03c6 \u223cg\n7\u2212p\n2\neff\nN\n.\n(6.13)\nThe curvature associated with the metric (6.12) is\nR \u223c\n1\nl2sgeff\n.\n(6.14)\nIn the form of the metric (6.12) it is easy to see that the UV/IR correspondence, as\ndescribed in section 3.1.3, leads to the relationship \u03bb \u223cz between wavelengths in the\ndual \ufb01eld theories and distances in the gravity solution. Through (6.11) we can then\nrelate energies in the \ufb01eld theory to distances in the u variable.\nIn the limit of in\ufb01nite u the e\ufb00ective string coupling (6.13) vanishes for p < 3. This\ncorresponds to the UV freedom of the Yang-Mills theory.\nFor p > 3 the coupling\nincreases and we have to use a dual description. This corresponds to the fact that\nthe Yang-Mills theory is non renormalizable and new degrees of freedom are required\nat short distances to de\ufb01ne the theory. The isometry group of the metric (6.12) is\nISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212p). The \ufb01rst factor corresponds to the Poincar\u00b4e symmetry group\nof the Yang-Mills theory and the second factor corresponds to its R-symmetry group.\nFor each Dp brane we can plot a phase diagram as a function of the two dimensionless\nparameters geff and N [647].\nDi\ufb00erent regions in the phase diagram have a good\ndescription in terms of di\ufb00erent variables.\nAs an example consider the D2 branes\nin Type IIA string theory. The dimensionless e\ufb00ective gauge coupling (6.8) is now\ng2\neff \u223cg2\nY MN/u. The perturbative Yang-Mills description is valid for geff \u226a1. When\ngeff \u223c1 we have a transition from the perturbative Yang-Mills description to the\nType IIA supergravity description. The Type IIA supergravity description is valid\n188\n\n\nwhen both the curvature is string units (6.14) and the e\ufb00ective string coupling (6.13)\nare small. This implies that N must be large.\nWhen geff > N2/5 the e\ufb00ective string coupling becomes large. In this region we\ngrow the eleventh dimension x11 and the good description is in terms of an eleven\ndimensional theory.\nWe can uplift the D2 brane solution (6.12) and (6.13) to an\neleven dimensional background that reduces to the ten dimensional background upon\nKaluza-Klein reduction on x11. This can be done using the relation between the ten\ndimensional Type IIA string metric ds2\n10 and the eleven dimensional metric ds2\n11,\nds2\n11 = e4\u03c6/3(dx2\n11 + A\u00b5dx\u00b5)2 + e\u22122\u03c6/3ds2\n10 .\n(6.15)\n\u03c6 and A\u00b5 are the Type IIA dilaton and RR gauge \ufb01eld. The 4-form \ufb01eld strength is\nindependent of x11.\nThe curvature of the eleven dimensional metric in eleven dimensional Planck units\nlp is given by\nR \u223ce2\u03c6/3\nl2\npgeff\n\u223c\ng2/3\neff\nl2\npN2/3 .\n(6.16)\nWhen the curvature (6.16) is small we can use the eleven dimensional supergravity\ndescription.\nThe metric (6.15) corresponds to the M2 branes solution smeared over the transverse\ndirection x11. The near-horizon limit of the supergravity solution describing M2 branes\nlocalized in the compact dimension x11 has the form (6.4), but with a harmonic function\nf of the form\nf =\n\u221e\nX\nn=\u2212\u221e\n32\u03c02l6\npN\n(r2 + (x11 \u2212x0\n11 + 2\u03c0nR11)2)3 ,\n(6.17)\nwhere r is the radial distance in the seven non-compact transverse directions and\nx11 \u223cx11 + 2\u03c0R11. x0\n11 corresponds to the expectation value of the scalar dual to the\nvector in the three dimensional gauge theory. The expression for the harmonic function\n(6.17) can be Poisson resummed at distances much larger than R11 = g2\nY Ml2\ns, leading\nto\nf = 6\u03c02Ng2\nY M\nl4\nsu5\n+ O(e\u2212u/g2\nY M) .\n(6.18)\nThe di\ufb00erence between the localized M2 branes solution and the smeared one is the\nexponential corrections in (6.18). They can be neglected at distances u \u226bg2\nY M, or\nin terms of the dimensionless parameters when geff \u226aN1/2. According to (6.11) this\ncorresponds to distance scales in the \ufb01eld theory of order\n\u221a\nN/g2\nY M. In this region we\ncan still use the up lifted D2 brane solution since it is the same as the one coming from\n(6.17) up to exponentially small corrections. When geff \u226bN1/2, which corresponds to\nvery low energies u \u226ag2\nY M, the sum in (6.17) is dominated by the n = 0 contribution.\n189\n\n\nThis background is of the form (6.4) (with f = 32\u03c02Nl6\np/r6), namely the near-horizon\nlimit of M2 branes in eleven non-compact dimensions.\nThis is the superconformal\ntheory which we discussed in the previous section. In \ufb01gure 6.1 we plot the transition\nbetween the di\ufb00erent descriptions as a function of the energy scale u. We see the \ufb02ow\nfrom the high energy N = 8 super Yang-Mills theory realized on the worldvolume of\nD2 branes to the low energy N = 8 SCFT realized on the worldvolume on M2 branes.\nu\ng YM\n2\nN\ng 2\nYMN\nN= 8    SCFT\ngYM\n2\nIIA  D2  brane\nUp lifted  D2  brane\n1/5\nPerturbative  SYM\nFigure 6.1: The di\ufb00erent descriptions of the D2 brane theory as a function of the energy\nscale u. We see the \ufb02ow from the high energy N = 8 super Yang-Mills theory to the\nlow energy N = 8 SCFT.\nA similar analysis can be done for the other Dp branes of the Type II string theories.\nIn the D0 branes case one starts at high energies with a perturbative super quantum\nmechanics description. At intermediate energies the good description is in terms of the\nType IIA D0 brane solution. At low energies the theory is expected to describe matrix\nblack holes [649]. In the D1 branes case one starts in the UV with a perturbative super\nYang-Mills theory in two dimensions. In the intermediate region the good description is\nin terms of the Type IIB D1 brane solution. The IR limit is described by the SymN(R8)\norbifold SCFT. The D3 branes correspond to the N = 4 SCFT discussed extensively\nabove.\nIn the D4 branes case, the UV de\ufb01nition of the theory is obtained by starting with\nthe six dimensional (2, 0) SCFT discussed in section 6.1.1, and compactifying it on\na circle. At high energies, higher than the inverse size of the circle, we have a good\ndescription in terms of the (2, 0) SCFT (or the AdS7 \u00d7 S4 background of M theory).\nThe intermediate description is via the background of the Type IIA D4 brane. Finally\nat low energies we have a description in terms of perturbative super Yang-Mills theory\nin \ufb01ve dimensions. In the D5 branes case we have a good description in the IR region\nin terms of super Yang-Mills theory. At intermediate energies the system is described\nby the near-horizon background of the Type IIB D5 brane, and in the UV in terms of\nthe solution of the Type IIB NS5 branes. We will discuss the NS5 brane theories in\nthe next section.\nConsider now the system of N D6 branes of Type IIA string theory. As before, we can\nattempt at a decoupling of the seven dimensional theory on the D6 branes worldvolume\nfrom the bulk by taking the string scale to zero and keeping the energies and the seven\n190\n\n\ndimensional Yang-Mills coupling \ufb01xed. The e\ufb00ective Yang-Mills coupling (6.8) is small\nat low energies u \u226a(g2\nY MN)\u22121/3 and super Yang-Mills is a good description in this\nregime. The curvature in string units (6.14) is small when u \u226b(g2\nY MN)\u22121/3 while the\ne\ufb00ective string coupling (6.13) is small when u \u226aN/g2/3\nY M. In between these limits we\ncan use the Type IIA supergravity solution.\nWhen u \u223cN/g2/3\nY M the e\ufb00ective string coupling is large and we should use the\ndescription of D6 branes in terms of eleven dimensional supergravity compacti\ufb01ed on\na circle with N Kaluza-Klein monopoles. Equivalently, the description is in terms of\neleven dimensional supergravity on an ALE space with an AN\u22121 singularity. When\nu \u226bN/g2/3\nY M the curvature of the eleven dimensional space vanishes and, unlike the\nlower dimensional branes, there does not not exist a seven dimensional \ufb01eld theory\nthat describes the UV. In fact, the D6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple\nfrom the bulk.\nA simple way to see that the D6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple from\nthe bulk is to note that now in the decoupling limit we keep g2\nY M \u223cgsl3\ns \ufb01xed. When\nwe lift the D6 branes solution to M theory, this means that the eleven dimensional\nPlanck length l3\np = gsl3\ns remains \ufb01xed, and therefore gravity does not decouple. An-\nother way to see that gravity does not decouple is to consider the system of D6 branes at\n\ufb01nite temperature in the decoupling limit. For large energy densities above extremal-\nity, E/V \u226bN/l7\np, we need the eleven dimensional description. This is given by an\nuncharged Schwarzschild black hole at the ALE singularity. The associated Hawking\ntemperature is TH \u223c1/\nq\nNl9\npE/V and there is Hawking radiation to the asymptotic re-\ngion of the bulk eleven dimensional supergravity. Generally, the worldvolume theories\nof Dp branes with p > 5 do not decouple from the bulk.\nThe supergravity computation of the Wilson loop, discussed in section 3.5, can be\ncarried out for the Dp brane theories. For instance for the N D2 branes theory one\ngets for the quark antiquark potential, using the type IIA SUGRA D2 brane solution\n[294],\nV = \u2212c(g2\nY MN)1/3\nL2/3\n,\n(6.19)\nwhere c is a positive numerical constant. In view of the discussion above, this result\nshould be trusted only for loops with sizes 1/g2\nY MN \u226aL \u226a\n\u221a\nN/g2\nY M. For smaller\nloops the computation fails because we go into the perturbative regime, where the\npotential becomes logarithmic. For larger loops we get into the AdS4 \u00d7 S7 region.\nOther works on Dp branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence are [650,\n648, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657].\n191\n\n\n6.1.4\nNS5 Branes\nThe NS5 branes of Type II string theories couple magnetically to the NS-NS B\u00b5\u03bd\n\ufb01eld, and they are magnetically dual to the fundamental string. Their tension is given\nby TNS \u22431/g2\nsl6\ns. Like the Dp branes, they are BPS objects that preserve half of\nthe supersymmetry of Type II theories.\nA fundamental string propagating in the\nbackground of N parallel NS5 branes is described far from the branes by a conformal\n\ufb01eld theory with non trivial metric, B \ufb01eld and dilaton, constructed in [658]. The\nstring coupling grows as the string approaches the NS5 branes. At low energies the six\ndimensional theory on the worldvolume of N Type IIB NS5 branes is a U(N) N = (1, 1)\nsuper Yang-Mills theory, which is free in the IR. However, it is an interacting theory\nat intermediate energies. At low energies the theory on the worldvolume of N Type\nIIA NS5 branes is the AN\u22121 (2, 0) SCFT discussed above.\nThe six dimensional theories on the worldvolume of NS5 branes of Type II string\ntheories were argued [659] to decouple from the bulk in the limit\ngs \u21920,\nls = fixed .\n(6.20)\nThis is because the e\ufb00ective coupling on the NS5 branes (e.g. the low-energy Yang-Mills\ncoupling in the type IIB case) is 1/ls, while the coupling to the bulk modes goes like\ngs. However, the computation of [660] showed that in this limit there is still Hawking\nradiation to the tube region of the NS5 brane solution, suggesting a non decoupling\nof the worldvolume theory from the bulk. In the spirit of the other correspondences\ndiscussed previously, one can reconcile the two by conjecturing [215] that string or M\ntheory in the NS5 brane background in the limit (6.20), which includes the tube region,\nis dual to the decoupled NS5 brane worldvolume theory (\u201clittle string theory\u201d). In\nparticular, the \ufb01elds in the tube which are excited in the Hawking radiation correspond\nto objects in the decoupled NS5 brane theory. In the following we will mainly discuss\nthe Type IIA NS5 brane theory3.\nThe Type IIA NS5 brane may be considered as the M5 brane localized on the eleven\ndimensional circle. Therefore its metric is that of an M5 brane at a point on a transverse\ncircle. In such a con\ufb01guration the near horizon metric of N NS5 branes can be written\nas [647, 215]\nds2\n=\nl2\np\n \nf \u22121/3(\u2212dt2 +\n5\nX\ni=1\ndx2\ni ) + f 2/3(dx2\n11 + du2 + u2d\u21262\n3)\n!\n,\nf\n=\n\u221e\nX\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c0N\n(u2 + (x11 \u22122\u03c0n/l2\ns)2)3/2 .\n(6.21)\nThe x11 coordinate is periodic and has been rescaled by l3\np (x11 \u2261x11 + 2\u03c0/l2\ns). The\nbackground also has a 4-form \ufb02ux of N units on S1 \u00d7 S3.\n3Type IIB NS5 branes at orbifold singularities are discussed in [661].\n192\n\n\nAt distances larger than ls\n\u221a\nN the NS5 brane theory is described by the AN\u22121 (2, 0)\nSCFT. Indeed, in the extreme low energy limit ls \u21920 the sum in (6.21) is dominated\nby the n = 0 term and the background is of the form AdS7 \u00d7 S4. This reduces to the\nconjectured duality between M theory on AdS7 \u00d7 S4 and the (2, 0) SCFT, discussed\npreviously. However, the NS5 brane theory is not a local quantum \ufb01eld theory at all\nenergy scales since at short distances it is not described by a UV \ufb01xed point. To see\nthis one can take ls to in\ufb01nity (or u to in\ufb01nity) in (6.21) and get a Type IIA background\nwith a linear dilaton. It has the topology of R1,5 \u00d7 R \u00d7 S3 with g2\ns(\u03c6) = e\u22122\u03c6/ls\n\u221a\nN,\nwhere \u03c6 is the R coordinate.\nThis is in accord with the fact that the NS5 brane\ntheory exhibits a T-duality property upon compacti\ufb01cation on tori (note that in this\nbackground a \ufb01nite radius in \ufb01eld theory units corresponds to a \ufb01nite radius in string\ntheory units on the string theory side of the correspondence, unlike the previous cases\nwe discussed).\nThe NS5 brane theories have an A-D-E classi\ufb01cation. This can be seen by viewing\nthem as Type II string theory on K3 with A-D-E singularities in the decoupling limit\n(6.20). The NS5 brane theories have an SO(4) R-symmetry which we identify with\nthe SO(4) isometry of S3. The IIA NS5 brane theories have a moduli space of vacua\nof the form (R4 \u00d7 S1)r/W where r is the rank of the A-D-E gauge group and W\nis the corresponding Weyl group.\nIt is parametrized by the W-invariant products\nof the 5r scalars in the r tensor multiplets. They fall into short representations of\nthe supersymmetry algebra.\nWe can match these chiral operators with the string\nexcitations in the linear dilaton geometry describing the large u region of (6.21). The\nstring excitations, in short representations of the supersymmetry algebra, in the linear\ndilaton geometry were analyzed in [215]. Indeed, they match the spectrum of the chiral\noperators in short representations of the NS5 brane theories. Actually, due to the fact\nthat the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary of the linear dilaton solution, one\ncan compute here the precise spectrum of chiral \ufb01elds in the string theory, and \ufb01nd an\nagreement with the \ufb01eld theory even for \ufb01nite N (stronger than the large N agreement\nthat we described in section 3.2).\nAs in the dualities with local quantum \ufb01eld theories, also here one can compute\ncorrelation functions by solving di\ufb00erential equations on the NS5 branes background\n(6.21). Since in this case the boundary is in\ufb01nitely far away, it is more natural to\ncompute correlation functions in momentum space, which correspond to the S-matrix\nin the background (6.21). The computation of two point functions of a scalar \ufb01eld\nwas sketched in [215] and described more rigorously in [662]. The NS5 brane theories\nare non-local, and this causes some di\ufb00erences in the matching between M theory and\nthe non-gravitational NS5 brane theory in this case. One di\ufb00erence from the previous\ncases we discussed is that in the linear dilaton backgrounds if we put a cuto\ufb00at some\nvalue of the radial coordinate (generalizing the discussion of [175] which we reviewed in\n193\n\n\nsection 3.1.3), the volume enclosed by the cuto\ufb00is not proportional to the area of the\nboundary (which it is in AdS space). Thus, if holography is valid in these backgrounds\n(in the sense of having a number of degrees of freedom proportional to the boundary\narea) it is more remarkable than holography in AdS space.\n6.2\nQCD\nThe proposed extension of the duality conjecture between \ufb01eld theories and superstring\ntheories to \ufb01eld theories at \ufb01nite temperature, as described in section 3.6, opens up\nthe exciting possibility of studying the physically relevant non supersymmetric gauge\ntheories. Of particular interest are non supersymmetric gauge theories that exhibit\nasymptotic freedom and con\ufb01nement. In this section, we will discuss an approach to\nstudying pure (without matter \ufb01elds) QCDp in p dimensions using a dual superstring\ndescription. We will be discussing mainly the cases p = 3, 4.\nThe approach proposed by Witten [185] was to start with a maximally supersym-\nmetric gauge theory on the p + 1 dimensional worldvolume of N Dp branes. One then\ncompacti\ufb01es the supersymmetric theory on a circle of radius R0 and imposes anti-\nperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle. Since the fermions do\nnot have zero frequency modes around the circle they acquire a mass mf \u223c1/R0. The\nscalars then acquire a mass from loop diagrams, and at energies much below 1/R0 they\ndecouple from the system. The expected e\ufb00ective theory at large distances compared\nto the radius of the circle is pure QCD in p dimensions. Note that a similar approach\nwas discussed in the treatment of gauge theories at \ufb01nite temperature T in section\n3.6, where the radius of the circle is proportional to 1/T. The high temperature limit\nof the supersymmetric gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions is thus described by a non\nsupersymmetric gauge theory in p dimensions.\nThe main obstacle to the analysis is clear from the discussions of the duality between\nstring theory and quantum \ufb01eld theories in the previous sections. The string approach\nto weakly coupled gauge theories is not yet developed. Most of the available tools\nare applicable in the supergravity limit that describes the gauge theory with a large\nnumber of colors and large \u2019t Hooft parameter. In this regime we cannot really learn\ndirectly about QCD, since the typical scale of candidate QCD states (glueballs) is\nof the same order of magnitude (for QCD4, or a larger scale for QCD3) as the scale\n1/R0 of the mass of the \u201cextra\u201d scalars and fermions.\nA related issue is that at\nshort distances asymptotically free gauge theories are weakly coupled and the dual\nsupergravity description is not valid. Therefore, we will be limited to a discussion in\nthe strong coupling region of the gauge theories and in particular we will not be able\nto exhibit asymptotic freedom.\n194\n\n\nOne may hope that a full solution of the classical (gs = 0) string theory will provide\na description of large N gauge theories for all couplings (in the \u2019t Hooft limit). To\nstudy the gauge theories with a \ufb01nite number of colors requires the quantum string\ntheory. However, there is also a possibility that the gauge description is valid for weak\ncoupling and the string theory description is valid for strong coupling with no smooth\ncrossover between the two descriptions. In such a scenario there is a phase transition\nat \u03bb = \u03bbc [315, 316]. This will prevent us from using the string description to study\nQCD, and will prevent classical string theory from being the master \ufb01eld for large N\nQCD.\nIn the last part of this section we will brie\ufb02y discuss another approach, based on a\nsuggestion by Polyakov [48], to study non supersymmetric gauge theories via a non su-\npersymmetric string description. In this approach one can exhibit asymptotic freedom\nqualitatively already in the gravity description. In the IR there are gravity solutions\nthat exhibit con\ufb01nement at large distances as well as strongly coupled \ufb01xed points.\n6.2.1\nQCD3\nThe starting point for studying QCD3 is the N = 4 superconformal SU(N) gauge the-\nory in four dimensions which is realized as the low energy e\ufb00ective theory of N coincid-\ning parallel D3 branes. As outlined above, the three-dimensional non-supersymmetric\ntheory is constructed by compactifying this theory on R3\u00d7S1 with anti-periodic bound-\nary conditions for the fermions around the circle. The boundary conditions break su-\npersymmetry explicitly and as the radius R0 of the circle becomes small, the fermions\ndecouple from the system since there are no zero frequency modes. The scalar \ufb01elds\nin the four dimensional theory will acquire masses at one-loop, since supersymmetry is\nbroken, and these masses become in\ufb01nite as R0 \u21920. Therefore in the infrared we are\nleft with only the gauge \ufb01eld degrees of freedom and the theory should be e\ufb00ectively\nthe same as pure QCD3.\nWe will now carry out the same procedure in the dual superstring (supergravity)\npicture. As has been extensively discussed in the previous sections, the N = 4 theory\non R4 is conjectured to be dual to type IIB superstring theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 with the\nmetric (3.5) or (3.6).\nRecall that the dimensionless gauge coupling constant g4 of the N = 4 theory is\nrelated to the string coupling constant gs as g2\n4 \u2243gs. In the \u2019t Hooft limit, N \u2192\u221e\nwith g2\n4N \u2243gsN \ufb01xed, the string coupling constant vanishes, gs \u21920. Therefore, we\ncould study the N = 4 theory using the tree level string theory in the AdS space\n(3.6). If also gsN \u226b1, the curvature of the AdS space is small and the string theory\nis approximated by classical supergravity.\nUpon compacti\ufb01cation on S1 with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions,\n195\n\n\n(3.6) is replaced by the Euclidean black hole geometry [181, 185] 4\nds2 = \u03b1\u2032q\n4\u03c0gsN\n \nu2(h(u)d\u03c4 2 +\n3\nX\ni=1\ndx2\ni ) + h(u)\u22121du2\nu2 + d\u21262\n5\n!\n,\n(6.22)\nwhere \u03c4 parametrizes the compactifying circle (with radius R0 in the \ufb01eld theory) and\nh(u) = 1 \u2212u4\n0\nu4 .\n(6.23)\nThe x1,2,3 directions correspond to the R3 coordinates of QCD3. The horizon of this\ngeometry is located at u = u0 with\nu0 =\n1\n2R0\n.\n(6.24)\nThe supergravity approximation is applicable for N \u2192\u221eand gsN \u226b1, so that all\nthe curvature invariants are small. The metric (6.22) describes the Euclidean theory,\nthe Lorentzian theory is obtained by changing P3\ni=1 dx2\ni \u2192\u2212dt2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2. Notice\nthat this is not the same as the Wick rotation that leads to the near extremal black\nhole solution (3.98).\nFrom the point of view of QCD3, the radius R0 of the compactifying circle provides\nthe ultraviolet cuto\ufb00scale. To obtain large N QCD3 itself (with in\ufb01nite cuto\ufb00), one\nhas to take g2\n4N \u21920 as R0 \u21920 so that the three dimensional e\ufb00ective coupling\ng2\n3N = g2\n4N/(2\u03c0R0) remains at the intrinsic energy scale of QCD3. g2\n3 is the classical\ndimensionful coupling of QCD3. The e\ufb00ective dimensionless gauge coupling of QCD3\nat the distance scale R0 is therefore gsN.\nThe proposal is that Type IIB string theory on the AdS black hole background (6.22)\nprovides a dual description to QCD3 (with the UV cuto\ufb00described above). The limit\nin which the classical supergravity description is valid, gsN \u226b1, is the limit where\nthe typical mass scale of QCD3, g2\n3N, is much larger than the cuto\ufb00scale 1/R0. It is\nthe opposite of the limit that is required in order to see the ultraviolet freedom of the\ntheory. Therefore, with the currently available techniques, we can only study large N\nQCD3 with a \ufb01xed ultraviolet cuto\ufb00R\u22121\n0\nin the strong coupling regime. It should be\nemphasized that by strong coupling we mean here that the coupling is large compared\nto the cuto\ufb00scale, so we really have many more degrees of freedom than just those of\nQCD3. QCD3 is the theory which we would get in the limit of vanishing bare coupling,\nwhich is the opposite limit to the one we are taking.\nThis is analogous to, but not the same as, the lattice strong coupling expansion with\na \ufb01xed cuto\ufb00given by the lattice spacing a (which is analogous to R0 here). There,\n4The stability issue of this background is discussed in [663].\n196\n\n\nQCD3 is obtained in the limit g2\n3a \u21920 while strong coupling lattice QCD3 is the\ntheory at large g2\n3a. An important di\ufb00erence in the approach that we take, compared\nto the lattice description, is that we have full Lorentz invariance in the three gauge\ntheory coordinates. The regularization of the gauge theory in the dual string theory\ndescription is provided by a one higher dimensional theory, the theory on D3 branes.\nIn the limit R0 \u21920 the geometry (6.22) is singular. As discussed above, in this\nlimit the supergravity description is not valid and we have to use the string theory\ndescription.\nCon\ufb01nement\nAs we noted before, the gauge coupling of QCD3 g2\n3 has dimensions of mass, and it\nprovides a scale already for the classical theory. The e\ufb00ective dimensionless expansion\nparameter at a length scale l, g2\n3(l) \u2261lg2\n3, goes to zero as l \u21920. Therefore, like QCD4,\nthe theory is free at short distances. Similarly, at a large length scale l the e\ufb00ective\ncoupling becomes strong. Therefore, the interesting IR physics is non-perturbative.\nIn three dimensions the Coulomb potential is already con\ufb01ning. This is a logarithmic\ncon\ufb01nement V (r) \u223cln(r). Lattice simulations provide evidence that in QCD3 at large\ndistances there is con\ufb01nement with a linear potential V (r) \u223c\u03c3r.\nTo see con\ufb01nement in the dual description we will consider the spatial Wilson loop.\nIn a con\ufb01ning theory the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop operator exhibits\nan area law behavior [664]\n\u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u2243exp(\u2212\u03c3A(C)) ,\n(6.25)\nwhere A(C) is the area enclosed by the loop C. The constant \u03c3 is called the string\ntension.\nThe area law (6.25) is equivalent to the quark-antiquark con\ufb01ning linear\npotential V (L) \u223c\u03c3L. This can be simply seen by considering a rectangular loop C\nwith sides of length T and L in Euclidean space as in \ufb01gure 6.2. For large T we have,\nwhen V (L) \u223c\u03c3L and interpreting T as the time direction,\n\u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u223cexp(\u2212TV (L)) \u223cexp(\u2212\u03c3A(C)) .\n(6.26)\nThe prescription to evaluate the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop oper-\nator in the dual string description has been introduced in section 3.5. It amounts to\ncomputing\n\u27e8W(C)\u27e9=\nZ\nexp(\u2212\u00b5(D)) ,\n(6.27)\nwhere \u00b5(D) is the regularized area of the worldsheet of a string D bounded at in\ufb01nity\nby C.\n197\n\n\nL\nT\nFigure 6.2: A con\ufb01ning quark-antiquark linear potential V (L) \u223c\u03c3L can be extracted\nfrom the Wilson loop obeying an area law \u27e8W(C)\u27e9\u223cexp(\u2212\u03c3TL).\nWe will work in the supergravity approximation in which (6.27) is approximated by\n\u27e8W(C)\u27e9= exp(\u2212\u00b5(D)) ,\n(6.28)\nwhere \u00b5(D) is the minimal area of a string worldsheet D bounded at in\ufb01nity by C.\nThis prescription has been applied in section 3.5 to the calculation of the Wilson\nloop in the N = 4 theory which is not a con\ufb01ning theory. Indeed, it has been found\nthere that it exhibits a Coulomb like behavior. The basic reason was that when we\nscaled up the loop C by xi \u2192\u03b1xi with a positive number \u03b1, we could use conformal\ninvariance to scale up D without changing its (regularized) area. Therefore D was not\nproportional to A(C). When scaling up the loop the surface D bends in the interior of\nthe AdS space. In the case when such a bending is limited by the range of the radial\ncoordinate one gets an area law. This is the case in the models at hand, in which the\ncoordinate u in (6.22) is bounded from below by u0 as in \ufb01gure 6.3.\nThe evaluation of the classical action of the string worldsheet bounded by the loop C\nat in\ufb01nite u is straightforward, as done in section 3.5 [327, 665]. The string minimizes\nits length by going to the region with the smallest possible metric component gii (where\ni labels the R3 directions), from which it gets the contribution to the string tension.\nThe smallest value of gii in the metric (6.22) is at the horizon. Thus, we \ufb01nd that\nthe Wilson loop exhibits an area law (6.25), where the string tension is given by the\ngii component of the metric (6.22) evaluated at the horizon u = u0 times a numerical\nfactor\n1\n2\u03c0 :\n\u03c3 = 1\n2\u03c0\nq\n4\u03c0gsNu2\n0 = (gsN)1/2\n4\u221a\u03c0R2\n0\n.\n(6.29)\n198\n\n\nu\nx\nu=u0\nc\nstring\nD\nFigure 6.3: The worldsheet of the string D is bounded at in\ufb01nite u by the loop C.\nThe string tends to minimize its length by going to the region with smallest metric\ncomponent gii, which in this case is near the horizon u = u0. The energy between the\nquark and the antiquark is proportional to the distance L between them and to the\nstring tension which is \u03c3 =\n1\n2\u03c0gii(u0).\nThe way supergravity exhibits con\ufb01nement has an analog in the lattice strong cou-\npling expansion, as \ufb01rst demonstrated by Wilson [664]. The leading contribution in\nthe lattice strong coupling expansion to the string tension is the minimal tiling by pla-\nquettes of the Wilson loop C as we show in \ufb01gure 6.4. This is analogous to the minimal\narea of the string worldsheet D ending on the loop C in \ufb01gure 6.3. One important\ndi\ufb00erence is that in the supergravity description the space is curved.\nOf course, a\ncomputation analogous to the Wilson loop computations we described in section 3.5\nwhich would be done in \ufb02at space would also exhibit con\ufb01nement, since the minimal\narea of the string worldsheet D ending on the loop C is simply the area enclosed by\nthe loop itself.\nThe quark-antiquark linear potential V = \u03c3L can have corrections arising from the\n\ufb02uctuations of the thin tube (string) connecting the quark and antiquark. L\u00a8uscher\nstudied a leading correction to the quark-antiquark potential at large separation L.\nWithin a class of bosonic e\ufb00ective theories in \ufb02at space that describe the vibrations of\nthe thin \ufb02ux tubes he found a universal term, \u2212c/L, called a L\u00a8uscher term [666] :\nV = \u03c3L \u2212c/L .\n(6.30)\nFor a \ufb02ux tube in d space-time dimensions c = (d \u22122)/24\u03c0. Lattice QCD calculations\nof the heavy quark potential have not provided yet a de\ufb01nite con\ufb01rmation of this\nsubleading term. This term can also not been seen order by order in the lattice strong\n199\n\n\nC\nFigure 6.4: The leading contribution in the lattice strong coupling expansion to the\nstring tension is the minimal tiling by plaquettes of the Wilson loop C.\ncoupling expansion. Subleading terms is this expansion are of the non minimal tiling\ntype, as in \ufb01gure 6.5, and correct only the string tension but not the linear behavior\nof the potential.\nC\nFigure 6.5: Subleading contribution in the lattice strong coupling expansion to the\nstring tension, which is a non minimal tiling of the Wilson loop. This is the lattice\nanalog of the \ufb02uctuations of the string worldsheet.\nThe computation of the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop (6.28) based\non the minimal area of the string worldsheet D does not exhibit the L\u00a8uscher term\n[667]. This is not surprising. Even if the the L\u00a8uscher term exists in QCD3, it should\noriginate from the \ufb02uctuations of the string worldsheet (6.27) that have not been taken\ninto account in (6.28). Some analysis of these \ufb02uctuations has been done in [300], but\nthe full computation has not been carried out yet.\nOther works on con\ufb01nement as seen by a dual supergravity description are [668, 669,\n670, 299].\n200\n\n\nMass Spectrum\nIf the dual supergravity description is in the same universality class as QCD3 it should\nexhibit a mass gap. In the following we will demonstrate this property. We will also\ncompute the spectrum of lowest glueball masses in the dual supergravity description.\nThey will resemble qualitatively the strong coupling lattice picture. We will also discuss\na possible comparison to lattice results in the continuum limit.\nThe mass spectrum in pure QCD can be obtained by computing the correlation\nfunctions of gauge invariant local operators (glueball operators) or Wilson loops, and\nlooking for the particle poles. As we discussed extensively before, correlation functions\nof local operators are related (in some limit) to tree level amplitudes in the dual su-\npergravity description. We will consider the two point functions of glueball operators\nO (for instance, we could take O = Tr(F 2)). For large |x \u2212y| it has an expansion of\nthe form\n\u27e8O(x)O(y)\u27e9\u2243\nX\nciexp(\u2212Mi|x \u2212y|) ,\n(6.31)\nwhere Mi are called the glueball masses.\nWe will classify the spectrum of glueballs by JP C where J is the glueball spin, P its\nparity and C its charge conjugation eigenvalue. The action of C on the gluon \ufb01elds is\n[671]\nC : Aa\n\u00b5T a\nij \u2192\u2212Aa\n\u00b5T a\nij ,\n(6.32)\nwhere the T a\u2019s are the hermitian generators of the gauge group.\nIn string theory,\ncharge conjugation corresponds to the worldsheet parity transformation changing the\norientation of the open strings attached to the D-branes.\nConsider \ufb01rst the lowest mass glueball state.\nIt carries 0++ quantum numbers.\nOne has to identify a corresponding glueball operator, namely a local gauge invariant\noperator with these quantum numbers.\nThe lowest dimension operator with these\nproperties is Tr(F 2), and we have to compute its two point function. To do that we\nneed to identify \ufb01rst the corresponding supergravity \ufb01eld that couples to it as a source\nat in\ufb01nite u. This is the Type IIB dilaton \ufb01eld \u03a6.\nThe correspondence between the gauge theory and the dual string theory picture\nasserts that in the SUGRA limit the computation of the correlation function amounts\nto solving the \ufb01eld equation for \u03a6 in the AdS black hole background (6.22),\n\u2202\u00b5(\u221agg\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03bd\u03a6) = 0 .\n(6.33)\nIn order to \ufb01nd the lowest mass modes we consider solutions of \u03a6 which are inde-\npendent of the angular coordinate \u03c4 and take the form \u03a6 = f(u)eikx. Plugging this in\n(6.33) we obtain the di\ufb00erential equation\n\u2202u[u(u4 \u2212u4\n0)\u2202uf(u)] + M2uf(u) = 0,\nM2 = \u2212k2 .\n(6.34)\n201\n\n\nThe eigenvalues M2 of this equation are the glueball masses squared.\nAt large u equation (6.34) has two independent solutions, whose asymptotic behavior\nis f \u223cconstant and f \u223c1/u4. We consider normalizable solutions and choose the\nsecond one. Regularity requires the vanishing of the derivative of f(u) at the horizon.\nThe eigenvalues M2 can be determined numerically [672, 673, 674], or approximately\nvia WKB techniques [672, 675].\nOne \ufb01nds that:\n(i) There are no solutions with eigenvalues M2 \u22640.\n(ii) There is a discrete set of eigenvalues M2 > 0.\nThis exhibits the mass gap property of the supergravity picture. In fact, even without\nan explicit solution of the eigenvalues M2 of equation (6.34), the properties (i) and (ii)\ncan be deduced from the structure of the equation and the requirement for normalizable\nand regular solutions [185].\nThe 0++ mass spectrum in the WKB approximation closely agrees with the more\naccurate numerical solution. It takes the form\nM2\n0++ \u22481.44n(n + 1)\nR2\n0\n,\nn = 1, 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(6.35)\nThe mass spectrum (6.35), that corresponds to a massless mode of the string in ten\ndimensions, is proportional to the cuto\ufb001/R0 and not to \u03c31/2, which is bigger by a\npower of gsN (6.29). This is qualitatively similar to what happens in strong coupling\nlattice QCD with lattice spacing a. As we will discuss in the next section, in the strong\ncoupling lattice QCD description the lowest masses of glueballs are proportional to 1/a.\nNote that in a stringy description of QCD we would expect the glueballs to correspond\nto string excitations, which are expected to have masses of order \u03c31/2. Therefore in the\nsupergravity limit, gsN \u226b1, the glueballs that correspond to the string excitations\nare much heavier than the \u201csupergravity glueballs\u201d which we analyzed.\nThe natural scale for the glueball masses of continuum QCD3 is g2\n3N. Therefore\nto get to the continuum QCD3 region we have to require g2\n3N \u226a1/R0 which implies\ngsN \u226a1. As discussed above, our computation is performed in the opposite limit\ngsN \u226b1. In particular, we do not have control over possible mixing between glueball\nstates and the other scalars and fermionic degrees of freedom which are at the same\nmass scale 1/R0 in the \ufb01eld theory.\nWe can attempt a numerical comparison of the supergravity computations with the\ncontinuum limit of lattice QCD, obtained by taking the bare coupling to zero. Since\nthese are computations at two di\ufb00erent limits of the coupling value (of the original\nN = 4 theory) there is apriori no reason for any agreement. Curiously, it turns out\nthat ratios of the glueball excited state masses with n > 1 in (6.35) and the lowest mass\nn = 1 state are in reasonably good agreement with the lattice computations (within\n202\n\n\nthe systematic and statistical error bars) [672, 676].\nAs a second example consider the spectrum of 0\u2212\u2212glueball masses. It can be com-\nputed via the \ufb01eld equations of the NS-NS 2-form \ufb01eld. The details of the computation\ncan be found in [672] and, as in the 0++ case, the ratios of the glueball masses are found\nto be in good agreement with the lattice computations.\nIn closing the numerical comparison we note another curious agreement between the\nsupergravity computation and the weak coupling lattice computations. This is for the\nratio of the lowest mass 0++ and 0\u2212\u2212glueball states,\n\u0010 M0\u2212\u2212\nM0++\n\u0011\nsupergravity\n= 1.50,\n\u0010M0\u2212\u2212\nM0++\n\u0011\nlattice\n= 1.45 \u00b1 0.08 .\n(6.36)\nAs stressed above, the regime where we would have liked to compute the mass\nspectrum is in the limit of small gsN (or large ultraviolet cuto\ufb001/R0). In this limit\nthe background is singular and we have to use the string theory description, which\nwe lack. We can compute the subleading correction in the strong coupling expansion\nto the masses. This requires the inclusion of the \u03b1\u20323 corrections to the supergravity\naction. The typical form of the masses is\nM2 = c0 + c1\u03b1\u20323/R6\nR2\n0\n,\n(6.37)\nwith c0 as in (6.35). The background metric is modi\ufb01ed by the inclusion of the \u03b1\u20323R4\nstring correction to the supergravity action. The modi\ufb01ed metric has been derived in\n[290, 677]. Based on this metric the corrections to the masses c1 have been computed in\n[672]. While these corrections signi\ufb01cantly change the glueball masses, the corrections\nto the mass ratios turn out to be relatively small.\nLattice computations may exhibit lattice artifacts due to the \ufb01nite lattice spacing.\nRemoving them amounts to taking a su\ufb03ciently small lattice spacing such that e\ufb00ec-\ntively the right physics of the continuum is captured. Getting close to the continuum\nmeans, in particular, that deviations from Lorentz invariance are minimized.\nAnalogous \u201cartifacts\u201d are seen in the dual supergravity description. They correspond\nto Kaluza-Klein modes that are of the same mass scale as the glueball mass scale. There\nare Kaluza-Klein modes from the circle coordinate \u03c4 in (6.22) that provides the cuto\ufb00\nto the three dimensional theory. They have a typical mass scale of order 1/R0. There\nare also SO(6) non-singlet Kaluza-Klein modes from the \ufb01ve-sphere in (6.22). In the\n\ufb01eld theory they correspond to operators involving the SO(6) non-singlet scalar and\nfermion \ufb01elds of the high-energy theory. They have a mass scale of order 1/R0 too.\nThe inclusion of the subleading \u03b1\u20323 correction does not make the Kaluza-Klein modes\nsu\ufb03ciently heavy to decouple from the spectrum [678, 672]. This means that the dual\n203\n\n\nsupergravity description is also capturing physics of the higher dimensions, or of the\nmassive scalar and fermion \ufb01elds from the point of view of QCD3. One hopes that upon\ninclusion of all the \u03b1\u2032 corrections, and taking the appropriate limit of small gsN (or\nlarge cuto\ufb001/R0), these Kaluza-Klein modes will decouple from the system and leave\nonly the gauge theory degrees of freedom. Currently, we do not have control over the\n\u03b1\u2032 corrections, which requires an understanding of a two dimensional sigma model with\na RR background. In section 6.2.3 we will use an analogy with lattice \ufb01eld theory to\nimprove on our supergravity description and remove some of the Kaluza-Klein modes.\n6.2.2\nQCD4\nOne starting point for obtaining QCD4 is the (2, 0) superconformal theory in six dimen-\nsions realized on N parallel coinciding M5-branes, which was discussed in section 6.1.\nThe compacti\ufb01cation of this theory on a circle of radius R1 gives a \ufb01ve-dimensional the-\nory whose low-energy e\ufb00ective theory is the maximally supersymmetric SU(N) gauge\ntheory, with a gauge coupling constant g2\n5 = 2\u03c0R1. To obtain QCD4, one compacti\ufb01es\nthis theory further on another S1 of radius R0. The dimensionless gauge coupling con-\nstant g4 in four dimensions is given by g2\n4 = g2\n5/(2\u03c0R0) = R1/R0. As in the previous\ncase, to break supersymmetry one imposes the anti-periodic boundary condition on the\nfermions around the second S1. And, as in the previous case, to really get QCD4 we\nneed to require that the typical mass scale of QCD states, \u039bQCD, will be much smaller\nthan the other mass scales in our construction (1/R1 and 1/R0), and this will require\ngoing beyond the supergravity approximation. However, one can hope that the theory\nobtained from the supergravity limit will be in the same universality class as QCD4,\nand we will give some evidence for this.\nAs discussed in section 6.1, the large N limit of the six-dimensional theory is M\ntheory on AdS7 \u00d7 S4. Upon compacti\ufb01cation on the two circles and imposing anti-\nperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions on the second S1, we get M theory on\na black hole background [185]. Taking the large N limit while keeping the \u2019t Hooft\nparameter 2\u03c0\u03bb = g2\n4N \ufb01nite requires R1 \u226aR0. We can now use the duality between\nM theory on a circle and Type IIA string theory, and the M5 brane wrapping on the\nS1 of radius R1 becomes a D4 brane. The large N limit of QCD4 then becomes Type\nIIA string theory on the black hole geometry given by the metric\nds2 = 2\u03c0\u03bb\n3u0\nu\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed4u2\n4\nX\ni=1\ndx2\ni + 4\n9u2\n0\nu2(1 \u2212u6\n0\nu6)d\u03c4 2 + 4\ndu2\nu2(1 \u2212u6\n0\nu6)\n+ d\u21262\n4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8,\n(6.38)\nwith a non constant dilaton background\ne2\u03c6 = 8\u03c0\u03bb3u3\n27u3\n0N2 .\n(6.39)\n204\n\n\nThe coordinates xi, i = 1, .., 4, parametrize the R4 gauge theory space-time, the coor-\ndinate u0 \u2264u \u2264\u221e, and \u03c4 is an angular coordinate with period 2\u03c0. The location of\nthe horizon is at u = u0, which is related to the radius R0 of the compactifying circle\nas\nu0 =\n1\n3R0\n.\n(6.40)\nEquivalently, we could have started with the \ufb01ve dimensional theory on the world-\nvolume of N D4 branes and heated it up to a \ufb01nite temperature T = 1/2\u03c0R0. Indeed,\nthe geometry (6.38) with the dilaton background (6.39) is the near horizon geometry\nof the non-extremal D4 brane background. But again, when we Wick rotate (6.38)\nback to Lorentzian signature we take one of the coordinates xi as time. Notice that\nthe string coupling (6.39) goes as 1/N.\nCon\ufb01nement\nQCD4 at large distances is expected to con\ufb01ne with a linear potential V (r) \u223c\u03c3r\nbetween non-singlet states. Therefore, the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson\nloop operator is expected to exhibit an area law behavior. In order to see this in the\ndual description we follow the same procedure as in QCD3.\nThe string tension \u03c3 is given by the coe\ufb03cient of the term P4\ni=1 dx2\ni in the metric\n(6.38), evaluated at the horizon u = u0, times a\n1\n2\u03c0 numerical factor :\n\u03c3 = 4\n3\u03bbu2\n0 =\n4\u03bb\n27R2\n0\n.\n(6.41)\nIn QCD4 it is believed that con\ufb01nement is a consequence of the condensation of\nmagnetic monopoles via a dual Meissner e\ufb00ect. Such a mechanism has been shown to\noccur in supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions [679]. This has also been\ndemonstrated to some extent on the lattice via the implementation of the \u2019t Hooft\nAbelian Projection [680]. We will now see that this appears to be the mechanism also\nin the dual string theory description [293].\nConsider the \ufb01ve dimensional theory on the world volume of the D4 branes.\nA\nmagnetic monopole is realized as a D2 brane ending on the D4 brane [165].\nIt is\na string in \ufb01ve dimensions. Upon compacti\ufb01cation on a circle, the four dimensional\nmonopole is obtained by wrapping the string on the circle.\nWe can now compute\nthe potential between a monopole and anti-monopole. This amounts to computing the\naction of a D2-brane interpolating between the monopole and the anti-monopole, which\nmediates the force between them as in \ufb01gure 6.6(a). This is the electric-magnetic dual\nof the computation of the quark-anti-quark potential described above.\nIf the pair is separated by a distance L in the x1 direction, and stretches along the\nx2 direction (which we can interpret as the Euclidean time), the D2 brane coordinates\n205\n\n\nare \u03c4, x1, x2. The action per unit length in the x2 direction is given by\nV =\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\u03b1\u20323/2\nZ L\n0 d\u03c4dx1e\u2212\u03c6\u221a\ndetG ,\n(6.42)\nwhere G is the induced metric on the D2 brane worldvolume.\nWe have to \ufb01nd a\ncon\ufb01guration of the D2-brane that minimizes (6.42).\nFor L > Lc where (up to a\nnumerical constant) Lc \u223cR0, there is no minimal volume D2 brane con\ufb01guration\nthat connects the monopole and the anti-monopole and the energetically favorable\ncon\ufb01guration is as in \ufb01gure 6.6(b). Therefore there is no force between the monopole\nand the anti-monopole, which means that the magnetic charge is screened. At length\nscales L \u226bR0 we expect pure QCD4 as the e\ufb00ective description. We see that in this\nregion con\ufb01nement is accompanied by monopole condensation, as we expect.\nu\nx\n\u03c4\nD2\nc\nc\n1\n1\n2\nL > Lc \nLc \nL <\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6.6: The magnetic monopole is a string in \ufb01ve dimensions and the four di-\nmensional monopole is obtained by wrapping the string on the circle. The potential\nbetween a monopole (wrapped on c1) and an anti-monopole (wrapped in the opposite\norientation on c2), separated by a distance L in the x1 direction, amounts to computing\nthe action of a D2-brane which mediates the force between them as in \ufb01gure (a). For\nL > Lc there is no minimal volume D2 brane con\ufb01guration that connects the monopole\nand the anti-monopole and the energetically favorable con\ufb01guration is as in \ufb01gure (b),\nand then the magnetic charge is screened.\n206\n\n\n\u03b8 Vacua\nIn addition to the gauge coupling, four dimensional gauge theories have an additional\nparameter \u03b8 which is the coe\ufb03cient of the Tr(F \u2227F) term in the Lagrangian. The \u03b8\nangle dependence of asymptotically free gauge theories captures non trivial dynamical\ninformation about the theory. Unlike in spontaneously broken gauge theories, it cannot\nbe analyzed by an instanton expansion. What is required is an appropriate e\ufb00ective\ndescription of the theories at long wavelengths. Such an e\ufb00ective description is provided\nby the lattice. However, since the Lorentz invariance is lost by the discretization of\nspace time, it is very di\ufb03cult to study questions such as the behavior of the system\nunder \u03b8 \u2192\u03b8 + 2\u03c0. Also, the construction of instantons which are the relevant objects\nin the analysis of the \u03b8 dependence is a rather non trivial task and involves delicate\ncooling techniques.\nAnother e\ufb00ective description may be provided by the description of the four dimen-\nsional gauge theories by the M5 brane wrapping a non supersymmetric cycle. Indeed,\nin this formalism, one sees that the vacuum energy exhibits the correct \u03b8 angle behavior\nin softly broken supersymmetric gauge theories [681].\nIn this subsection we use the dual string theory description to analyze the \u03b8 angle\ndependence in large N SU(N) gauge theory [682]. Since the amplitude for an instanton\nis weighted by a factor exp(\u22128\u03c02N/\u03bb) where \u03bb is the \u2019t Hooft parameter (which we\nkeep \ufb01xed), it naively seems that the instanton e\ufb00ects vanish as N \u2192\u221e. However,\nunlike the N = 4 gauge theory for instance, here one expects this not to be the case\ndue to IR divergences in the theory.\nLet us \ufb01rst review what we expect the behavior of the \u03b8 dependence to be from the\n\ufb01eld theory viewpoint. The Yang-Mills action is\nIY M =\nZ\nd4xTr( N\n4\u03bbF 2 +\n\u03b8\n16\u03c02F \u02dcF) .\n(6.43)\nAt large N we expect the energy of the vacuum to behave like E(\u03b8) = N2C(\u03b8/N). The\nN2 factor is due to the fact that this is the order of the number of degrees of freedom\n(this also follows from the standard scaling of the leading diagrams in the \u2019t Hooft\nlimit). The dependence on \u03b8/N follows from (6.43) as is implied by the large N limit.\n\u03b8 is chosen to be periodic with period 2\u03c0. Since the physics should not change under\n\u03b8 \u2192\u03b8 + 2\u03c0 we require that E(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = E(\u03b8).\nThese conditions cannot be satis\ufb01ed by a smooth function of \u03b8/N. They can be\nsatis\ufb01ed by a multibranched function with the interpretation that there are N inequiv-\nalent vacua, and all of them are stable in the large N limit. The vacuum energy is\nthen given by a minimization of the energy of the kth vacuum Ek with respect to k\nE(\u03b8) = min\nk\nEk(\u03b8) = N2 min\nk\nC((\u03b8 + 2\u03c0k)/N) ,\n(6.44)\n207\n\n\nfor some function C(\u03b8) which is quadratic in \u03b8 for small values of \u03b8.\nE\n\u03b8\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\u22122\u03c0\nFigure 6.7: The energy of the vacuum is expected to be a multibranched function.\nThe function E(\u03b8) is periodic in \u03b8 and jumps at some values of \u03b8 between di\ufb00erent\nbranches. The CP transformation acts by \u03b8 \u2192\u2212\u03b8 and is a symmetry only for \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0.\nTherefore, C(\u03b8) = C(\u2212\u03b8). One expects an absolute minimum at \u03b8 = 0 and a non\nvanishing of the second derivative of E(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8, which corresponds to the\ntopological susceptibility \u03c7t of the system as we will discuss later. Taking all these\nfacts into account one conjectures in the leading order in 1/N that [683]\nE(\u03b8) = \u03c7t min\nk (\u03b8 + 2\u03c0k)2 + O(1/N) ,\n(6.45)\nwhere \u03c7t is positive and independent of N. At \u03b8 = \u03c0 the function exhibits the jump\nbetween the vacua at k = 0 and k = \u22121 and the spontaneous breaking of CP invariance.\nIn order to analyze the \u03b8 dependence in the dual string theory description with the\nbackground (6.38) we have to identify the \u03b8 parameter. This is done by recalling that\nthe e\ufb00ective Lagrangian of N D4 branes in Type IIA string theory has the coupling\n1\n16\u03c02\nZ\nd5x\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4A\u03c1Tr(F\u03b1\u03b2F\u03b3\u03b4) ,\n(6.46)\nwhere A is the Type IIA RR 1-form and F is the U(N) gauge \ufb01eld strength on the\n\ufb01ve dimensional brane worldvolume. Upon compacti\ufb01cation of the D4 brane theory on\na circle we see that the four dimensional \u03b8 parameter is related to the integral of the\nRR 1-form on the circle. Since it is a ten dimensional \ufb01eld it is a parameter from the\nworldvolume point of view.\nIn the dual description we de\ufb01ne the parameters at in\ufb01nite u. The \u03b8 parameter is\nde\ufb01ned as the integral of the RR 1-form component on the circle at in\ufb01nite u\n\u03b8 =\nZ\nd\u03c4A\u03c4 = 2\u03c0A\u221e\n\u03c4 ,\n(6.47)\nwhich is de\ufb01ned modulo 2\u03c0k, k \u2208Z.\n208\n\n\nThe action for the RR 1-form takes the form\nI =\n1\n2\u03ba2\n10\nZ\nd10x\u221ag1\n4g\u03b1\u03b1\u2032g\u03b2\u03b2\u2032(\u2202\u03b1A\u03b2 \u2212\u2202\u03b2A\u03b1)(\u2202\u03b1\u2032A\u03b2\u2032 \u2212\u2202\u03b2\u2032A\u03b1\u2032) ,\n(6.48)\nand the equation of motion for A is\n\u2202\u03b1[\u221agg\u03b2\u03b3g\u03b1\u03b4(\u2202\u03b3A\u03b4 \u2212\u2202\u03b4A\u03b3)] = 0 .\n(6.49)\nThe required solution A\u03c4(u) to (6.49), regular at u = u0 and with vanishing \ufb01eld\nstrength at in\ufb01nite u (in order to have \ufb01nite energy), takes the form\nA\u03c4(u) = A\u221e\n\u03c4 (1 \u2212u6\n0\nu6) .\n(6.50)\nEvaluating the Type IIA action for the RR 1-form (6.48) with the solution (6.50) and\nrecalling the 2\u03c0Z ambiguity we get the vacuum energy (6.45) where \u03c7t is independent\nof N [682].\nIn order to check that the vacua labeled by k are all stable in the limit N \u2192\u221ewe\nneed a way to estimate their lifetime. The domain wall separating two adjacent vacua\nis constructed by wrapping a D6 brane of Type IIA string theory on the S4 part of the\nmetric [682]. Since the energy density of the brane at weak coupling is of order 1/gs\nwhere gs is the Type IIA string coupling, as N \u2192\u221e(with \ufb01xed gsN) it is of order N.\nIf we assume a mechanism for the decay of a k-th vacuum via a D6 brane bubble, its\ndecay rate is of the order of e\u2212N. Thus, there is an in\ufb01nite number of stable vacua in\nthe in\ufb01nite N limit.\nOne can repeat the discussion of con\ufb01nement in the previous subsection for \u03b8 \u0338= 0.\nWhen \u03b8 = 2\u03c0p/q with co-prime integers p, q the con\ufb01nement is associated with a\ncondensation of (\u2212p, q) dyons and realizes the mechanism of oblique con\ufb01nement.\nMass Spectrum\nThe analysis of the mass spectrum of QCD4 as seen by the dual description in the\nsupergravity limit is similar to the one we carried out for QCD3. It is illuminating to\nconsider an analogous picture of strong coupling lattice QCD [293].\nIn strong coupling lattice QCD the masses of the lightest glueballs are of order 1/a\nwhere a is the lattice spacing. The reasoning is that in strong coupling lattice QCD\nthe leading contribution to the correlator of two Wilson loops separated by distance L\nis from a tube with the size of one plaquette, as in \ufb01gure 6.8, that connects the loops.\nWith the Wilson lattice action the 0++ glueball mass is given by [684]\nM0++ = \u22124 log(g2\n4N)a\u22121 .\n(6.51)\n209\n\n\na\nL\nFigure 6.8: The leading contribution in strong coupling lattice QCD to the correlator\nof two Wilson loops, separated by distance L, is from a tube with the size of one\nplaquette that connects the loops. This leads to the lowest mass glueballs having a\nmass of the order of 1/a, where a is the lattice spacing.\nTo make the connection with continuum QCD4 we would like to sum the lattice\nstrong coupling expansion M0++ = F(g2\n4N)a\u22121, and take the limit a \u21920 and g4 \u21920\nwith\ng2\n4N \u2243\n1\nblog(1/a\u039bQCD)\nas\na \u21920 ,\n(6.52)\nwhere g4 is the four dimensional coupling and b is the \ufb01rst coe\ufb03cient of the \u03b2-function.\nWe hope that in the limit (6.52) we will get a \ufb01nite glueball mass measured in \u039bQCD\nunits.\nIn the dual string theory description the analog of a is R0. The strong coupling\nexpansion is analogous to the \u03b1\u2032 expansion of string theory. Supergravity is the leading\ncontribution in this expansion. The lowest glueball masses Mg correspond to the zero\nmodes of the string, and their mass is proportional to 1/R0. Another way to see that\nthis limit resembles the strong coupling lattice QCD picture is to consider the Wilson\nloop correlation function \u27e8W(C1)W(C2)\u27e9as in \ufb01gure 6.9(a).\nFor L > Lc, where L is the distance between the loops and Lc is determined by the\nsize of the loops, there is no stable string worldsheet con\ufb01guration connecting the two\nloops, as in \ufb01gure 6.9(b). The string worldsheet that connects the loops as in \ufb01gure\n6.10(a) collapses and the two disks are now connected by a tube of string scale size as\nin \ufb01gure 6.10(b), resembling the strong coupling lattice QCD picture. The correlation\nfunction is then mediated by a supergraviton exchange between the disks. Thus, the\nsupergravitons are identi\ufb01ed with the glueball states and the lowest glueball masses\n210\n\n\nturn out to be proportional to 1/R0 [293].\nu=u\nx\nu\nc\nc\nc\nc\nL < L\n0\n2\n1\n2\n1\nc\n(b)\n(a)\nL > Lc\nFigure 6.9: The Wilson loop correlation function in \ufb01gure (a) is computed by mini-\nmization of the string worldsheet that interpolates between them. When the distance\nbetween the loops L is larger than Lc there is no stable string worldsheet con\ufb01guration\nconnecting the two loops as in \ufb01gure (b).\nAs in strong coupling lattice QCD, to make the connection with the actual QCD4\ntheory we need to sum the strong coupling expansion Mg = F(g2\n4N)/R0 and take the\nlimit of R0 \u21920 and g4 \u21920 with\ng2\n4N \u2192\n1\nblog(1/R0\u039bQCD)\nas\nR0 \u21920 .\n(6.53)\nAgain, we hope that in the limit (6.53) we will get a \ufb01nite glueball mass proportional\nto \u039bQCD.\nIn the limit (6.53) the background (6.38) is singular. Thus, to work at large N in\nthis limit we need the full tree level string theory description and not just the SUGRA\nlimit.\nThe supergravity description will provide us with information analogous to\nthat of strong coupling lattice QCD with a \ufb01nite cuto\ufb00. However, since as discussed\nbefore the regularization here is done via a higher dimensional theory, we will have the\nadvantage of a full Lorentz invariant description in four dimensions. What we should\nbe worried about is whether we capture the physics of the higher dimensions as well\n(which from the point of view of QCD4 correspond to additional charged \ufb01elds).\nIn order to compute the mass gap we consider the scalar glueball 0++. The 0++\nglueball mass spectrum is obtained by solving the supergravity equation for any mode\n211\n\n\nL < Lc\nL > Lc\nsupergraviton\n(a)\nC\n(b)\nC\nC\nC\n1\n1\n2\n2\nFigure 6.10: The string worldsheet that connects the loops in \ufb01gure (a) collapses and\nthe two disks are now connected by a tube of a string scale as in \ufb01gure (b). The\ncorrelation function is mediated by a supergraviton exchange between the disks and\nthe supergravitons are identi\ufb01ed with the glueball states.\nf that couples to 0++ glueball operators; we expect (and this is veri\ufb01ed by the calcu-\nlation) that the lightest glueball will come from a mode that couples to the operator\nTr(F 2). There are several steps to be taken in order to identify this mode and its\nsupergravity equation. First, we consider small \ufb02uctuations of the supergravity \ufb01elds\non the background (6.38), (6.39). The subtlety that arises is the need to disentangle\nthe mixing between the dilaton \ufb01eld and the volume factor which has been done in\n[685]. One then plugs the appropriate \u201cdiagonal\u201d combinations of these \ufb01elds into the\nsupergravity equations of motion. The \ufb01eld/operator identi\ufb01cation can then be done\nby considering the Born-Infeld action of the D4 brane in the gravitational background.\nTo compute the lowest mass modes we consider solutions of the form f = f(u)eikx\nwhich satisfy the equation\n1\nu3\u2202u[u(u6 \u2212u6\n0)\u2202uf(u)] + M2f(u) = 0 .\n(6.54)\nThe eigenvalues M2 are the glueball masses. The required solutions are normalizable\nand regular at the horizon. The eigenvalues M2 can be determined numerically [685]\nor approximately via WKB techniques [675].\nAs in QCD3 one \ufb01nds that:\n(i) There are no solutions with eigenvalues M2 \u22640.\n(ii) There is a discrete set of eigenvalues M2 > 0.\nThis exhibits the mass gap property of the supergravity picture.\n212\n\n\nThe 0++ mass spectrum in the WKB approximation closely agrees with the more\naccurate numerical solution. It takes the form\nM2 \u22480.74n(n + 2)\nR2\n0\n,\nn = 1, 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(6.55)\nAs in QCD3, the ratios of the glueball excited state masses with n > 1 in (6.55) and the\nlowest mass n = 1 state are in good agreement with the available lattice computations\n[685, 672].\nAs another example consider the 0\u2212+ glueballs. The lowest dimension operator with\nthese quantum numbers is Tr(F \u02dcF).\nAs we discussed previously, on the D4 brane\nworldvolume it couples to the RR 1-form A\u03c4 (6.46). Its equation of motion is given by\n(6.49). We look for solutions of the form A\u03c4 = f\u03c4(u)eikx. Plugging this into (6.49) we\nget\n1\nu5(u6 \u2212u6\n0)\u2202u[u7\u2202uf\u03c4(u)] + u4M2f\u03c4(u) = 0 .\n(6.56)\nAs for the 0++ glueball states, the ratios of the 0\u2212+ glueball masses are found to be in\ngood agreement with the lattice computations [685].\nFinally, we note that the ratio of the lowest masses 0++ and 0\u2212+ glueball states [685]\n\u0012M0\u2212+\nM0++\n\u0013\nsupergravity\n=\n1.20,\n\u0012M0\u2212+\nM0++\n\u0013\nlattice\n=\n1.36 \u00b1 0.32 ,\n(6.57)\nagrees with the lattice results too.\nSimilar types of agreements in mass spectrum\ncomputations were claimed in strong coupling lattice QCD [686]. However, note that\n(as discussed above for QCD3) other ratios, such as the ratio of the glueball masses to\nthe square root of the string tension, are very di\ufb00erent in the SUGRA limit from the\nresults in QCD.\nThe computation of the mass gap in the dual supergravity picture is in the opposite\nlimit to QCD. As in the supergravity description of QCD3, also here the Kaluza-Klein\nmodes do not decouple. In this approach, in order to perform the computation in the\nQCD regime we need to use string theory. The surprising agreement of certain mass\nratios with the lattice results may be a coincidence. Optimistically, it may have an\nunderlying dynamical reason.\nCon\ufb01nement-Decon\ufb01nement Transition\nWe will now put the above four dimensional QCD-like theory at a \ufb01nite temperature\nT (which should not be confused with\n1\n2\u03c0R0). We will see that there is a decon\ufb01nement\ntransition. In order to consider the theory at \ufb01nite temperature we go to Euclidean\n213\n\n\nspace and we compactify the time direction tE on a circle of radius \u03b2 with antiperiodic\nfermion boundary conditions. Since we already had one circle (labeled by \u03c4 in (6.38)),\nwe now have two circles with antiperiodic boundary conditions.\nSo, we can have\nseveral possible gravity solutions.\nOne is the original extremal D4 brane, another\nis the solution (6.38) and a third one is the same solution (6.38) but with \u03c4 and\ntE interchanged. These last two solutions are possible only when the fermions have\nantiperiodic boundary conditions on the corresponding circles. One of the last two\nsolutions always has lower free energy than the \ufb01rst, so we concentrate on these last\ntwo.\nIt turns out that the initial solution (6.38) has the lowest free energy for low tem-\nperatures, when \u03b2 = 1/T > 2\u03c0R0, while the one with \u03c4 \u2194tE has the lowest free\nenergy for \u03b2 = 1/T < 2\u03c0R0 (high temperatures). The entropy of these two solutions\nis very di\ufb00erent, and therefore there is a \ufb01rst order phase transition, in complete anal-\nogy with the discussion in section 3.6. We do not know of a proof that there are no\nother solutions, but these two solutions have di\ufb00erent topological properties, so there\ncannot be a smoothly interpolating solution. In any case, for very low and very high\ntemperatures they are expected to be the dominant con\ufb01gurations (see [663])5. The\nentropy of the the high temperature phase is of order N2, while the entropy of the low\ntemperature phase is essentially zero since the number of states in the gravity picture\nis independent of the Newton constant.\nIf we compute the potential between a quark and an antiquark then in the low\ntemperature phase it grows linearly, so that we have con\ufb01nement, while in the high\ntemperature phase the strings coming from the external quarks can end on the horizon,\nso that the potential vanishes beyond a certain separation. Thus, this is a con\ufb01nement-\ndecon\ufb01nement transition. It might seem a bit surprising at \ufb01rst sight that essentially\nthe same solution can be interpreted as a con\ufb01ned and a decon\ufb01ned phase at the same\ntime.\nThe point it that quark worldlines are timelike, therefore they select one of\nthe two circles, and the physical properties depend crucially on whether this circle is\ncontractible or not in the full ten-dimensional geometry.\nOther Dynamical Aspects\nIn this subsection we comment on various aspects of QCD4 as seen by the string\ndescription. We \ufb01rst show how the baryons appear in the dual string theory (M theory)\npicture. We will then compute other properties of the QCD vacuum, the topological\nsusceptibility and the gluon condensate, as seen in the dual description.\nBaryons\n5There are other singular solutions [620], but the general philosophy is that we do not allow singular\nsolutions unless we can give a physical interpretation for the singularity.\n214\n\n\nThe baryon is an SU(N) singlet bound state of N quarks. Since we do not have\nquarks in our theory, we need to put in external quarks as described in section 3.5,\nand then there is a baryon operator coupling N external quarks. As in the conformal\ncase, also here it can be constructed as N open strings that end on a D4 brane that is\nwrapped on S4 [293, 216], as in \ufb01gure 6.11. If we view this geometry as arising from\nM-theory, then the strings are M2 branes wrapping the circle with periodic fermion\nboundary conditions and the D4 brane is an M5 \ufb01vebrane also wrapping this circle.\nThen, N M2 branes can end on this M5 brane as in [216]. There is a very similar\npicture of a baryon in strong coupling lattice QCD as is depicted in \ufb01gure 6.12, where\nquarks are connected by \ufb02ux links to a vertex.\nq\nq\n1\nu=u0\nu\nx\nN\nFigure 6.11: The baryon is an SU(N) singlet bound state of N quarks. It is constructed\nas N open strings that join together at a point in the bulk AdS black hole geometry.\nSeveral aspects of baryon physics can be seen from the string picture of \ufb01gure 6.11\n[216, 293]. The baryon energy is proportional to the string tension (6.41) and (in the\nlimit of large distances between the quarks) to the sum of the distances between the N\nquark locations and the location of the baryon vertex in the four dimensional x-space\n[293, 392, 393]. (There is some subtlety in evaluating the baryon energy, and it was\nclari\ufb01ed in [394] in the case of N = 4 gauge theory. See also [395, 399].) We may\nconsider the baryon vertex as a \ufb01xed (non-dynamical) point in the Born Oppenheimer\napproximation. In such an approximation, the N quarks move independently in the\npotential due to the string stretched between them and the vertex. The baryon mass\nspectrum can be computed by solving the one body problem of the quark in this\npotential. Corrections to this spectrum can be computed by taking into account the\npotential between the quarks and the dynamics of the vertex. A similar analysis has\nbeen carried out in the \ufb02ux tube model [687] based on the Hamiltonian strong coupling\n215\n\n\nFigure 6.12: A baryon state in strong coupling lattice QCD. The quarks located at\nlattice sites are connected by \ufb02ux links to a vertex. A similar picture is obtained by\nprojecting the baryon vertex in \ufb01gure 6.11 on x space.\nlattice formulation [688].\nIn a con\ufb01ning theory we do not expect to see a baryonic con\ufb01guration made from\nk < N quarks. This follows for the above description. If we want to separate a quark\nwe will be left with a string running to in\ufb01nity, which has in\ufb01nite energy.\nTopological Susceptibility\nThe topological susceptibility \u03c7t measures the \ufb02uctuations of the topological charge\nof the QCD vacuum. It is de\ufb01ned by\n\u03c7t =\n1\n(16\u03c02)2\nZ\nd4x\u27e8Tr(F \u02dcF(x))Tr(F \u02dcF(0))\u27e9.\n(6.58)\nAt large N the Witten-Veneziano formula [689, 690] relates the mass m\u03b7\u2032 in SU(N)\nYang-Mills gauge theory with Nf quarks to the topological susceptibility of SU(N)\nYang-Mills theory without quarks:\nm2\n\u03b7\u2032 = 4Nf\nf 2\u03c0\n\u03c7t .\n(6.59)\nEquation (6.59) is applicable at large N where f 2\n\u03c0 \u223cN. In this limit m\u03b7\u2032 goes to zero\nand we have the \u03b7\u2032 \u2212\u03c0 degeneracy.\nNevertheless, plugging the phenomenological values Nf = 3, N = 3, m\u03b7\u2032 \u223c1 GeV, f\u03c0 \u223c\n0.1 GeV in (6.59) leads to a prediction \u03c7t \u223c(180 MeV )4, which is in surprising agree-\nment with the lattice simulation for a \ufb01nite number of colors [691].\nEvaluating the 2-point function from the type IIA SUGRA action for the RR 1-form\n216\n\n\n(6.48) with the solution (6.50), we get the topological susceptibility\n\u03c7t =\n2\u03bb3\n729\u03c03R4\n0\n.\n(6.60)\nThe supergravity result (6.60) depends on two parameters, \u03bb and R0. This is the\nleading asymptotic behavior in 1/\u03bb of the full string theory expression \u03c7t \u223c(F(\u03bb)/R0)4.\nWe would have liked to compute F(\u03bb), take the limit (6.53) and compare to the lattice\nQCD result. However, this goes beyond the currently available calculational tools.\nIt may be instructive, though, to consider the following comparison. Let us assume\nthat there is a cross-over between the supergravity description and the continuum\nQCD description. We can estimate the cross-over point. In perturbative QCD we \ufb01nd\nF(\u03bb) \u223ce\u221212\u03c0/11\u03bb, therefore the cross-over point (to the F \u223c\u03bb3/4 behavior of (6.60))\ncan be estimated to be at \u03bb \u223c12\u03c0/11. Also, since the mass scale in the QCD regime is\n\u039bQCD, at the cross-over point T = 1/2\u03c0R0 \u223c\u039bQCD \u223c200 MeV . Of course, we should\nbear in mind that at the cross-over point both the supergravity and perturbative QCD\nare not applicable descriptions. If we compare the topological susceptibility (6.60) at\nthe correspondence point with the lattice result we get\n \u03c7SUGRA\nt\n\u03c7Lattice\nt\n!1/4\n= 1.7 .\n(6.61)\nIt may be an encouraging sign that the number we get is of order one, though its level\nof agreement is not as good as the mass ratios of the glueball spectrum.\nGluon Condensation\nThe gluon condensate \u27e81\n4g2\n4 Tr(F 2(0))\u27e9is related by the trace anomaly to the energy\ndensity T\u00b5\u00b5 of the QCD vacuum. In the supergravity picture the one point function of\nan operator corresponds to the \ufb01rst variation of the supergravity action. This quantity\nis expected to vanish by the equations of motion. However, the \ufb01rst variation is only\nrequired to vanish up to a total derivative term. Since asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nspace has a time-like boundary at in\ufb01nity, there is a possible boundary contribution.\nIndeed, unlike the N = 4 case, the one point function of the Tr(F 2) operator in the\ndual string theory description of QCD does not vanish.\nIt can be computed either directly or by using the relation between the thermal\npartition function and the free energy Z(T) = exp(\u2212F/T).\nThis relates the free\nenergy associated with the string theory (supergravity) background to the expectation\nvalue of the operator Tr(F 2). One gets [685]\n\u27e81\n4g2\n4\nTr(F 2\n\u00b5\u03bd(0))\u27e9= 1\n8\u03c0\nN2\n\u03bb \u03c32 .\n(6.62)\n217\n\n\nThe relation (6.62) between the gluon condensate and the string tension is rather\ngeneral and applies for other regular backgrounds that are possible candidates for a\ndual description [692].\nIf we attempt again a numerical comparison with the lattice computation [693, 694]\nwe \ufb01nd at the cross-over point\n (Gluon condensate)SUGRA\n(Gluon condensate)Lattice\n!1/4\n= 0.9 .\n(6.63)\nWe should note that in \ufb01eld theory the gluon condensate is divergent, and there are\nsubtleties (which are not completely settled) as to the relation between the lattice\nregularized result and the actual property of the QCD vacuum.\nFinally, for completeness of the numerical status, we note that if we compare the\nstring tension (6.41) at the cross-over point and the lattice result we get\n (QCD string tension)SUGRA\n(QCD string tension)Lattice\n!1/2\n= 2 .\n(6.64)\n6.2.3\nOther Directions\nIn this subsection we brie\ufb02y review other possible ways of describing non supersym-\nmetric asymptotically free gauge theories via a dual string description.\nAdditional\npossibilities are described in section 4.3.\nDi\ufb00erent Background Metrics\nThe string models dual to QCDp that we studied exhibit the required qualitative prop-\nerties, such as con\ufb01nement, a mass gap and the \u03b8 dependence of the vacuum energy,\nalready in the supergravity approximation. We noted that besides the glueball mass\nspectrum there exists a spectrum of Kaluza-Klein modes at the same mass scale. This\nindicates that the physics of the higher dimensions is not decoupling from the four\ndimensional physics6. The Kaluza-Klein states did not decouple upon the inclusion\nof the \u03b1\u20323 correction, but one hopes that they do decouple in the full string theory\nframework. In the following we discuss an approach to removing some of them already\nat the supergravity level. It should be stressed, however, that this does not solve the\nissue of a possible mixing between the glueball states and states that correspond to\nthe scalar and fermion \ufb01elds, which for large \u03bb are at the same mass scale in the \ufb01eld\ntheory.\n6From the \ufb01eld theory point of view it indicates that SU(4)-charged \ufb01elds and KK modes of \ufb01ve\ndimensional \ufb01elds contribute in addition to the four dimensional gluons.\n218\n\n\nAgain, the analogy with lattice gauge theory is useful. It is well known in the lattice\nframework that the action one starts with has a signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ect on the speed at which\none gets to the continuum limit. One can add to the lattice action deformations which\nare irrelevant in the continuum limit and arrive at an appropriate e\ufb00ective description\nof the continuum theory while having a larger lattice spacing. Such actions are called\nimproved actions.\nA similar strategy in the dual supergravity description amounts to a modi\ufb01cation of\nthe background metric. The requirement is that the modi\ufb01cation will better capture the\ne\ufb00ective description of the gauge theory while still having a \ufb01nite cuto\ufb00(corresponding\nto \ufb01nite \u03bb in our case). On the lattice a criterion for improvement is Lorentz invariance.\nHere, since the cuto\ufb00is provided by a higher dimensional theory we have the full\nLorentz invariance in any case. The improvement will be measured by the removal\nof the Kaluza-Klein modes. Note that we are attempting at an improvement in the\nstrong coupling regime. Such ideas have only now begun to be explored on the lattice\n[695]. Till now, the e\ufb00ort of lattice computations was directed at the computation of\nthe strong coupling expansion series.\nModels that generalize the above background by the realization of the gauge theories\non non-extremal rotating branes have been studied in [696, 692, 320]. The deformation\nof the background is parametrized by the angular momentum parameter.\nKaluza-\nKlein modes associated with the circle have the form \u03a6 = f(u)eikxein\u03c4, n > 0. It has\nbeen shown that as one varies the angular momentum one decouples these Kaluza-Klein\nmodes, while maintaining the stability of the glueball mass spectrum. This deformation\nis not su\ufb03cient to decouple also the Kaluza-Klein modes associated with the sphere\npart of the metrics (6.22) and (6.38), so we are still quite far from QCD.\nThe number of non-singular backgrounds is limited by the no hair theorem. One\nmay consider more angular momenta, for instance. However, this does not seem to\nbe su\ufb03cient to decouple all the Kaluza-Klein states [697, 698].\nIt is possible that\nwe will need to appeal to non regular backgrounds in order to fully decouple the\nhigher dimensional physics. Some non supersymmetric singular backgrounds of Type\nII supergravity that exhibit con\ufb01nement were constructed and discussed in [421, 422,\n423, 426].\nType 0 String Theory\nThe Type 0 string theories have worldsheet supersymmetry but no space-time super-\nsymmetry as a consequence of a non-chiral GSO projection [699, 700]. Consider two\ntypes of such string theories, Type 0A and Type 0B. They do not have space-time\nfermions in their spectra. Nevertheless, they have a modular invariant partition func-\ntion. The bosonic \ufb01elds of these theories are like those of the supersymmetric Type\n219\n\n\nIIA and Type IIB string theories, with a doubled set of Ramond-Ramond \ufb01elds. Type\n0 string theories can be formally viewed as the high temperature limit of the Type II\nstring theories. They contain a tachyon \ufb01eld T .\nType 0 theories have D-branes. As in the Type II case, we can consider the gauge\ntheories on the worldvolume of N such branes. These theories do not contain an open\nstring tachyon. Moreover, the usual condensation of the tachyon could be avoided in\nthe near horizon region as we explain below.\nOne particular example studied in [701] is the theory on N \ufb02at D3 branes in Type\n0B theory. Since there is a doubled set of RR 4-form \ufb01elds in Type 0B string theory,\nthe D3 branes can carry two charges, electric and magnetic. The worldvolume theory\ntheory of N \ufb02at electric D3 branes is a U(N) gauge theory with six scalars in the\nadjoint representation of the gauge group. There are no fermionic \ufb01elds. The classical\naction is derived by a dimensional reduction of the pure SU(N) gauge theory action\nin ten dimensions. The six scalars are the components of the gauge \ufb01elds in the re-\nduced dimensions. The classical theory has an SO(6) global symmetry that rotates\nthe six scalars.\nThis allows several possible parameters (from the point of view of\nrenormalizable \ufb01eld theory) : a gauge coupling gY M, a mass parameter for the scalars\nm and various scalar quartic potential couplings gi, one of which appears in the clas-\nsical Lagrangian. In the classical worldvolume action, the mass parameter is zero and\nthe gi are \ufb01xed in terms of gY M, it is just the dimensional reduction of the ten dimen-\nsional bosonic Yang-Mills theory. Quantum mechanically, the parameters are corrected\ndi\ufb00erently and can take independent values. The theory has a phase diagram depend-\ning on these parameters. Generically we expect to see in the diagram Coulomb-like\n(Higgs) phases, con\ufb01nement phases and maybe non trivial RG \ufb01xed points arising from\nparticular tunings of the parameters.\nAs in the case of D branes in Type II theories, one can conjecture here that the\nlow-energy theory on the electric D3 branes has a dual non supersymmetric string\ndescription. At \ufb01rst sight this should involve a solution of AdS5 \u00d7 S5 type. The closed\nstring tachyon might be allowed in AdS if the curvature is of the order of the string\nscale, since in that case the tachyon would obey the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound\n(2.42). The fact that the curvatures are of the order of the string scale renders the\ngravity analysis invalid. In principle we should solve the worldsheet string theory. Since\nwe do not know how to do that at present we can just do a gravity analysis and hope\nthat the full string theory analysis will give similar results. It was observed in [701]\nthat the tachyon potential includes the terms\n1\n2m2e\u22122\u03a6T 2 + |F|2\n \n1 + T + T 2\n2\n!\n,\n(6.65)\nwhere F is the electric RR \ufb01ve form \ufb01eld strength (the magnetic one couples in a similar\nway but with T \u2192\u2212T ). The fact that the RR \ufb01elds contribute positively to the mass\n220\n\n\nallows curvatures which, numerically, are a bit less than the string scale. Furthermore,\nit has been noticed in [702] that the \ufb01rst string correction to this background seems\nto vanish. These conditions on the curvature translate into the condition gsN < O(1)\nwhich is precisely what we expect to get in QCD.\nAn interesting feature is that, due to the potential (6.65) the tachyon would have\na nonzero expectation value and that induces a variation of the dilaton \ufb01eld \u03a6 in the\nradial coordinate via the equation [675, 702]\n\u22072\u03a6 = 1\n8m2e\u03a6/2T 2,\nm2 = \u22122\n\u03b1\u2032 .\n(6.66)\nSince the radial coordinate is associated with the energy scale of the gauge theory,\nthis variation may be interpreted as the \ufb02ow of the coupling. In the UV (large radial\ncoordinate) the tachyon is constant and one \ufb01nds a metric of the form AdS5 \u00d7S5. This\nindicates a UV \ufb01xed point. The coupling vanishes at the UV \ufb01xed point, and this\nmakes the curvature of the gravity solution in\ufb01nite in the UV, but that is precisely\nwhat is expected since the \ufb01eld theory is UV free. The running of the coupling is\nlogarithmic, though it goes like 1/(log E)2. However, the quark-antiquark potential\ngoes as 1/ log E due to the square root in (3.95).\nIn the IR (small radial coordinate) the tachyon vanishes and one \ufb01nds again a solution\nof the form AdS5 \u00d7S5. In the IR the coupling is in\ufb01nite. Therefore this solution seems\nto exhibit a strong coupling IR \ufb01xed point. However, since the dilaton is large, classical\nstring theory is not su\ufb03cient to study the \ufb01xed point theory. The gravity solution at\nall energy scales u has not been constructed yet.\nGenerically one expects the gauge theory to have di\ufb00erent phases parametrized by\nthe possible couplings. The IR \ufb01xed point should occur as a particular tuning of the\ncouplings. Indeed, other solutions at small radial coordinate were constructed in [703]\nthat exhibit con\ufb01nement and a mass gap.\nMoreover they were argued to be more\ngeneric than the IR \ufb01xed point solution.\nIt was pointed out in [704] that the theories on the D3 branes of Type 0B string\ntheory are particular examples of the orbifold models of N = 4 theory that we studied\nin section 4.1.1. The R-symmetry of N = 4 theory is SU(4), the spin cover of SO(6).\nIt has a center Z4 and one can orbifold with respect to it or its subgroups \u0393. The\ntheory on N \ufb02at electric D3 branes arises when the action of \u0393 on the Chan-Paton\n(color) indices is in a trivial representation. This orbifold is not in the class of \u201cregular\nrepresentations\u201d which we discussed in section 4.1.1; in particular, in this case the beta\nfunction does not vanish in the planar diagram limit. If we study instead the theory\narising on N self-dual D3-branes of type 0 (which may be viewed as bound states of\nelectric and magnetic D3-branes) we \ufb01nd a theory which is in the class of \u201cregular\nrepresentation orbifolds\u201d [705], and behaves similarly to type II D3-branes in the large\nN limit. We will not discuss this theory here.\n221\n\n\nAs with the D branes in Type II string theory, we can construct a large number of non\nsupersymmetric models in Type 0 theories by placing the D branes at singularities. One\nexample is the theory of D3 branes of Type 0B string theory at a conifold singularity.\nAs discussed in section 4.1.3, when placing N D3 branes of Type IIB string theory\nat a conifold the resulting low-energy worldvolume theory is N = 1 supersymmetric\nSU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge theory with chiral super\ufb01elds Ak, k = 1, 2 transforming in the\n(N, \u00afN) representation and Bl, l = 1, 2 transforming in the ( \u00afN, N) representation, and\nwith some superpotential.\nOn the worldvolume of N electric D3 branes of Type 0B string theory at a conifold\nthere is a truncation of the fermions and one gets an SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge theory\nwith complex scalar \ufb01elds Ak, k = 1, 2 transforming in the (N, \u00afN) representation and\nBl, l = 1, 2 transforming in the ( \u00afN, N) representation. This theory (at least if we set to\nzero the coe\ufb03cient of the scalar potential which existed in the supersymmetric case) is\nasymptotically free. The gravity description of this model has been analyzed in [706].\nIn the UV one \ufb01nds a solution of the form AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 which indicates a UV \ufb01xed\npoint. The e\ufb00ective string coupling vanishes in accord with the UV freedom of the\ngauge theory. In the IR one \ufb01nds again a solution of the form AdS5 \u00d7T 1,1 with in\ufb01nite\ncoupling that points to a strong coupling IR \ufb01xed point. Of course, one expects the\ngauge theory to have di\ufb00erent phases parametrized by the possible couplings. Indeed,\nthere are other more generic solutions that exhibit con\ufb01nement and a mass gap [706].\nOther works on dual descriptions of gauge theories via the Type 0 D branes are\n[707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713].\n222\n\n\nChapter 7\nSummary and Discussion\nWe conclude by summarizing some of the successes and remaining open problems of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence.\nFrom the \ufb01eld theory point of view we have learned and understood better many\nproperties of the large N limit. Since \u2019t Hooft\u2019s work [3] we knew that the large N limit\nof gauge theories should be described by strings, if the parameter g2\nY MN is kept \ufb01xed.\nThrough the correspondence we have learned that not only does this picture really\nwork (beyond perturbation theory where it was \ufb01rst derived), but that the Yang-Mills\nstrings (made from gluons) are the same as the fundamental strings. Moreover, these\nstrings move in higher dimensions, as was argued in [47].\nThese extra dimensions\narise dynamically in the gauge theory. For some \ufb01eld theories the curvatures in the\nhigher dimensional space could be small. The prototypical example is N = 4 super-\nYang-Mills with large N, g2\nY MN. From this example we can obtain others by taking\nquotients, placing branes at various singularities, etc. (section 4.1). In all cases for\nwhich we can \ufb01nd a low-curvature gravity description we can do numerous calculations\nin the large N limit. We can calculate the spectrum of operators and states (sections\n3.2, 3.4).\nWe can calculate correlation functions of operators and of Wilson loops\n(sections 3.3, 3.5). We can calculate thermal properties, like the equation of state\n(section 3.6), and so on.\nIf the \ufb01eld theory is conformal the gravity solution will include an AdS factor. It is\npossible, in principle, to deform the theory by any relevant operators. In some cases\nfairly explicit solutions have been found for \ufb02ows between di\ufb00erent conformal \ufb01eld\ntheories (section 4.3). A \u201cc-theorem\u201d for \ufb01eld theories in more than two dimensions\nwas proven within the gravity approximation. It would be very interesting to generalize\nthis beyond this approximation.\nIt would also be interesting to understand better\nexactly what it is the class of \ufb01eld theories which have a gravity approximation. One\nconstraint on such four dimensional conformal \ufb01eld theories, described in section 3.2.2,\nis that they must have a = c.\n223\n\n\nIt is possible to give a \ufb01eld theory interpretation to various branes that one can have\nin the AdS description (section 4.2). Some correspond to baryons in the \ufb01eld theory,\nothers to various defects like domain walls, etc. In the AdS5 case D-instantons in the\nstring theory correspond to gauge theory instantons in the \ufb01eld theory.\nIn general, the large N limit of a gauge theory should have a string theory descrip-\ntion. Whether it also has a gravity description depends on how large the curvatures\nin this string theory are. If the curvatures are small, we can have an approximate\nclassical gravity description. Otherwise, we should consider all string modes on the\nsame footing. This involves solving the worldsheet theories for strings in Ramond-\nRamond backgrounds. This is a problem that only now is beginning to be elucidated\n[525, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721]. For non-supersymmetric QCD, or other\ntheories which are weakly coupled (as QCD is at high energies), we expect to have\ncurvatures at least of the order of the string scale, so that a proper understanding of\nstrings on highly curved spaces seems crucial.\nIt is also possible to deform the N = 4 \ufb01eld theory, breaking supersymmetry and\nconformal invariance, by giving a mass to the fermions or by compactifying the theory\non a circle with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions. Then, we have a theory\nthat should describe pure Yang-Mills theory at low energies (sections 4.3, 3.6, 6.2). In\nthe case of \ufb01eld theories compacti\ufb01ed on a circle with supersymmetry breaking bound-\nary conditions and large g2\nY MN at the compacti\ufb01cation scale, one can show that the\ntheory is con\ufb01ning, has a mass gap, has \u03b8-vacua with the right qualitative properties\nand has a con\ufb01nement-decon\ufb01nement transition at \ufb01nite temperature. However, in the\nregime where the analysis can be done (small curvature) this theory includes many\nadditional degrees of freedom beyond those in the standard bosonic Yang-Mills the-\nory. In order to do quantitative calculations in bosonic Yang-Mills one would have to\ndo calculations when the curvatures are large, which goes beyond the gravity approx-\nimation and requires understanding the propagation of strings in Ramond-Ramond\nbackgrounds. Unfortunately, this is proving to be very di\ufb03cult, and so far we have not\nobtained new results in QCD from the correspondence. As discussed in section 6.2,\nthe gravity approximation resembles the strong coupling lattice QCD description [664],\nwhere the \u03b1\u2032 expansion of string theory corresponds to the strong coupling expansion.\nThe gravity description has an advantage over the strong coupling lattice QCD de-\nscription by being fully Lorentz invariant. This allows, for instance, the analysis of\ntopological properties of the vacuum which is a di\ufb03cult task in the lattice description.\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence does provide direct evidence that QCD is describable\nas some sort of string theory (to the extent that we can use the name string theory for\nstrings propagating on spaces whose radius of curvature is of the order of the string\nscale or smaller).\nOne of the surprising things we learned about \ufb01eld theory is that there are various\n224\n\n\nnew large N limits which had not been considered before. For instance, we can take\nN \u2192\u221ekeeping gY M \ufb01xed, and the AdS/CFT correspondence implies that many\nproperties of the \ufb01eld theory (like correlation functions of chiral primary operators)\nhave a reasonable limiting behavior in this limit, though there is no good \ufb01eld theory\nargument for this. Similarly, we \ufb01nd that there exist large N limits for theories which\nare not gauge theories, like the d = 3, N = 8 and d = 6, N = (2, 0) superconformal\n\ufb01eld theories, and for various theories with less supersymmetry. The existence of these\nlimits cannot be derived directly in \ufb01eld theory.\nThe correspondence has also been used to learn about the properties of \ufb01eld theories\nwhich were previously only poorly understood. For instance, it has been used [343] to\nunderstand properties of two dimensional \ufb01eld theories with singular target spaces, and\nto learn properties of \u201clittle string theories\u201d, like the fact that they have a Hagedorn\nbehavior at high energies. The correspondence has also been used to construct many\nnew conformal \ufb01eld theories, both in the large N limit and at \ufb01nite N.\nAnother interesting case is topological Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions,\nwhich is related to a topological string theory in six dimensions [329]. In this case one\ncan solve exactly both sides of the correspondence and see explicitly that it works.\nThe correspondence is also useful for studying non-conformal gauge theories, as we\ndiscussed in section 6.1.3. A particularly interesting case is the maximally supersym-\nmetric quantum mechanical SU(N) gauge theory, which is related to Matrix theory\n[26, 722, 723, 647, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730].\nFrom the quantum gravity point of view we have now an explicit holographic de-\nscription for gravity in many backgrounds involving an asymptotically AdS space. The\n\ufb01eld theory e\ufb00ectively sums over all geometries which are asymptotic to AdS. This\nde\ufb01nes the theory non-perturbatively. This also implies that gravity in these spaces is\nunitary, giving the \ufb01rst explicit non-perturbative construction of a unitary theory of\nquantum gravity,1 albeit in a curved space background. Black holes are some mixed\nstates in the \ufb01eld theory Hilbert space. Explicit microscopic calculations of black hole\nentropy and greybody factors can be done in the AdS3 case (chapter 5).\nBasic properties of quantum gravity, such as approximate causality and locality at\nlow energies, are far from clear in this description [181, 279, 171, 179, 177, 731, 182],\nand it would be interesting to understand them better. We are also still far from having\na precise mapping between general con\ufb01gurations in the gravitational theory and in\nthe \ufb01eld theory (see [732, 178] for some attempts to go in this direction).\nIn principle one can extract the physics of quantum gravity in \ufb02at space by taking\nthe large radius limit of physics in AdS space. Since we have not discussed this yet\n1In the context of Matrix theory [26] we need to take a large N limit which is not well understood\nin order to describe a theory of gravity in a space with no closed light-like curves.\n225\n\n\nin the review, let us expand on this here, following [733, 734, 180, 735] (see also [178,\n736, 737, 738]). We would like to be able to describe processes in \ufb02at space which\noccur, for instance, at some \ufb01xed string coupling, with the energies and the size of the\ninteraction region kept \ufb01xed in string (or Planck) units. Computations on AdS space\nare necessarily done with some \ufb01nite radius of curvature; however, we can view this\nradius of curvature as a regulator, and take it to in\ufb01nity at the end of any calculation,\nin such a way that the local physics remains the same. Let us discuss what this means\nfor the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 case (the discussion is similar for other cases). We need to keep the\nstring coupling \ufb01xed, and take N \u2192\u221esince the radius of curvature in Planck units is\nproportional to N1/4. Note that this is di\ufb00erent from the \u2019t Hooft limit, and involves\ntaking \u03bb \u2192\u221e. In order to describe a scattering process in space-time which has \ufb01nite\nenergies in this limit, it turns out that the energies in the \ufb01eld theory must scale as\nN1/4 (measured in units of the scale of the S3 which the \ufb01eld theory is compacti\ufb01ed\non; we need to work in global AdS coordinates to describe \ufb02at-space scattering). In\nthis limit the \ufb01eld theory is very strongly coupled and the energies are also very high,\nand there are no known ways to do any computations on the \ufb01eld theory side.\nIt\nwould be interesting to compute anything explicitly in this limit.\nFor example, it\nwould be interesting to compute the entropy of a small Schwarzschild black hole, much\nsmaller than the radius of AdS, to see \ufb02at-space Hawking radiation, and so on. If we\nstart with AdS5 \u00d7 S5 this limit gives us the physics in \ufb02at ten dimensional space, and\nsimilarly starting with AdS4 \u00d7 S7 or AdS7 \u00d7 S4 we can get the physics in \ufb02at eleven\ndimensional space. It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence can\nbe used to learn about theories with lower dimension, where some of the dimensions\nare compacti\ufb01ed. A limit of string theory on AdS3 \u00d7 S3 \u00d7 M4 may be used to give\nstring theory on R5,1 \u00d7 M4, but it is not clear how to get four dimensional physics out\nof the correspondence.\nOne could, in principle, get four dimensional \ufb02at space by starting from AdS2 \u00d7 S2\ncompacti\ufb01cations.\nHowever, the correspondence in the case of AdS2 spaces is not\nwell understood. AdS2 spaces arise as the near horizon geometry of extremal charged\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes. Even though \ufb01elds propagating in AdS2 behave sim-\nilarly to the higher dimensional cases [739], the problem is that any \ufb01nite energy\nexcitation seems to destroy the AdS2 boundary conditions [342]. This is related to\nthe fact that black holes (as opposed to black p-branes, p > 0) have an energy gap\n(see section 5.7), so that in the extreme low energy limit we seem to have no exci-\ntations. One possibility is that the correspondence works only for the ground states.\nEven then, there are instantons that can lead to a fragmentation of the spacetime into\nseveral pieces [740]. Some conformal quantum mechanics systems that are, or could\nbe, related to AdS2 were studied in [741, 742, 743, 729]. Aspects of Hawking radiation\nin AdS2 were studied in [744].\n226\n\n\nIn all the known cases of the correspondence the gravity solution has a timelike\nboundary2. It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence works when\nthe boundary is light-like, as in Minkowski space. It seems that holography must work\nquite di\ufb00erently in these cases (see [745, 746] for discussions of some of the issues in-\nvolved). In the cases we understand, the asymptotic space close to the boundary has\na well de\ufb01ned notion of time, which is the one that is associated to the gauge the-\nory. It would be interesting to understand how holography works in other spacetimes,\nwhere we do not have this notion of time. Interesting examples are spatially closed\nuniverses, expanding universes, de-Sitter spacetimes, etc. See [747, 748, 749, 750] for\nsome attempts in this direction. The precise meaning of holography in the cosmological\ncontext is still not clear [751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757].\nTo summarize, the past 18 months have seen much progress in our understanding of\nstring/M theory compacti\ufb01cations on AdS and related spaces, and in our understand-\ning of large N \ufb01eld theories. However, the correspondence is still far from realizing the\nhopes that it initially raised, and much work still remains to be done. The correspon-\ndence gives us implicit ways to describe QCD and related interesting \ufb01eld theories in\na dual \u201cstringy\u201d description, but so far we are unable to do any explicit computations\nin the \ufb01eld theories that we are really interested in. The main hope for progress in\nthis direction lies in a better understanding of string theory in RR backgrounds. The\ncorrespondence also gives us an explicit example of a unitary and holographic theory\nof quantum gravity. We hope this example can be used to better understand quan-\ntum gravity in \ufb02at space, where the issues of unitarity (the \u201cinformation problem\u201d)\nand holography are still quite obscure. Even better, one could hope that the corre-\nspondence would hint at a way to formulate string/M theory independently of the\nbackground. These questions will apparently have to wait until the next millennium.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank T. Banks, M. Berkooz, A. Brandhuber, M. Douglas, D. Freed-\nman, S. Giddings, D.

We review the background for this correspondence and discuss its motivations and the evidence for its correctness. We describe the main",
