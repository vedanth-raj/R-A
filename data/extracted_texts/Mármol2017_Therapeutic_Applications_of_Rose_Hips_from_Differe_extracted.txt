Abstract: Rosa species, rose hips, are widespread wild plants that have been traditionally used as
medicinal compounds for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. The therapeutic potential
of these plants is based on its antioxidant effects caused by or associated with its phytochemical
composition, which includes ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds and healthy fatty acids among others.
Over the last few years, medicinal interest in rose hips has increased as a consequence of recent
research that has studied its potential application as a treatment for several diseases including skin
disorders, hepatotoxicity, renal disturbances, diarrhoea, inﬂammatory disorders, arthritis, diabetes,
hyperlipidaemia, obesity and cancer. In this review, the role of different species of Rosa in the
prevention of treatment of various disorders related to oxidative stress, is examined, focusing on new
therapeutic approaches from a molecular point of view.

2. Introduction
2.1. Origin of Oxidation: The Importance of Natural Antioxidants
Vegetables and fruits are an important source for therapeutic products which can prevent, relieve
or cure numerous illnesses as they are an important source of phytochemicals and other bioactive
compounds. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are implicated in a large number of illnesses, especially
chronic ones. Nitrogenous species and free radicals start chain reactions which can favour the initiation
and progression of many complications in diseases [1,2]. Oxidative stress may be deﬁned as an
imbalance between ROS levels in the organism and the capacity of antioxidant mechanisms. A free
radical is a species which contains one or more unpaired electrons, which makes them very reactive
as they need another electron to ﬁll the orbital and become more stable. Free radicals are formed in

different ways: (i) many organic molecules (glyceraldehydes, adrenaline, L-dopa, dopamine, cysteine
etc.) oxidize in the presence of O2 to form the superoxide radical; (ii) many of these radicals in vivo
are produced by an incomplete transfer of electrons on O2 just before the terminal cytochrome oxidase
step [3]. The superoxide radical (O2•−), which is very active, is formed when a single electron is
added to the ground state O2 molecule. Sometimes the presence of ROS in the organism is beneﬁcial
as they are used in the immune response to kill ingested or extra-cellular bacteria. Unfortunately,
ROS are not limited to this action and they can also contribute to undesired effects as they induce
oxidation processes. The term “antioxidant paradox” is often used to refer that ROS are implicated
in several human diseases but there is no good evidence, in human population, that large doses of
dietary antioxidants have always preventive or therapeutic effects [4]. In addition, there are some
environmental factors which contribute to the production of free radicals such as exposure to ultraviolet
radiation, pollution and cigarette smoke. Nitrogen dioxide, one of the major oxidants in smog, is also
found in cigarette smoke. Two free radicals have been found in tobacco smoke, the main radical NO•,
found in tar, is capable of reducing oxygen to the superoxide radical [3].
The antioxidants family include a series of molecules with low oxidation potential which act
by donating electrons to deactivate ROS and other free radicals that produce DNA damage and
consequently can provoke tumorigenesis [3]. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals through different
mechanisms like Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT), Single Electron Transfer followed by Proton Transfer
(SET or ET-PT) and the Sequential Proton Loss Electron Transfer (SPLET) mechanism. Each one
of these mechanisms presents different kinetics [5]. When the free radicals are generated in vivo,
many antioxidants act in order to defend the organism from oxidative damage. In the organism
there is a ﬁrst line of defence made up of peroxidases and metal chelating proteins which serve
as a preventive barrier as they inhibit the formation of ROS and free radicals by capturing metal
ions, reducing hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide and quenching superoxide and singlet oxygen [6].
A second line of defence is formed by vitamin C and vitamin E which scavenge radicals and so prevent
any propagation reactions. The third line of defence of the organism repairs lipids, proteins, sugars
and DNA with oxidative damage. This also includes proteases, lipases, DNA repair enzymes and
transferases [7]. The antioxidants used could be endogenous such as catalases, which transform H2O2
to O2 and H2O, and superoxide dismutases, which convert superoxide radical (O2•−) to H2O2 and
O2, or likewise they could be exogenous, coming from one’s diet. Diet is very important as this
provides the antioxidants that intervene in the second line of defence such as vitamin C and E and
other antioxidants such as β-carotene, phenols including ﬂavonoids and essential minerals, which
participate in the formation of the antioxidant enzymes. Natural antioxidants are found, above all, in
vegetables, herbs, berries, spices, tea, coffee and cocoa. For all these reasons, different epidemiological
studies have reached the conclusion that consumption of these products, of vegetable origin, are
associated with a lower risk of suffering chronic diseases as well as with lower mortality [8,9].
Likewise, antioxidants are a type of additive which is used in the food-processing industry
with the aim of preventing an oxidizing deterioration of the lipids as well as preventing loss of
nutrition values and the development of odours in the food. The antioxidants additives allowed
in food industry may be synthetic or natural, although currently natural antioxidants are more
readily acceptable than synthetic antioxidants. The most used synthetic antioxidants in the food
processing industry are: butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG)
and di-tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), all of which are phenolic synthetic antioxidants. However,
since the late XX century the use of synthetic antioxidants additives has become restricted because of
their possible toxic and carcinogenic effects [10]. This question has caught the attention of both the
scientiﬁc community as well as among the general public, and currently there is a lot of interest
in developing methods that could provide information and means of isolating both individual
antioxidants or those present in extracts coming from different natural sources. Thus, among the
positive list of additives permitted by the EU can be found rosemary extract (E392) and different
types of tocopherols (E306 an extract rich in tocopherols, E307 α-tocopherol, E308 γ-tocopherol, E309

δ-tocopherol). Given that rose hips are rich in vitamins, especially, vitamin C, as well as phenolic
compounds, carotenoids, tocopherol, bioﬂavonoids, tannins, volatile oils and pectins [11–15], these
pseudo-fruits could constitute an alternative source of antioxidants for the food industry as well as
serving for therapeutic use.
2.2. Presence of Antioxidants in Rose Hips Coming from Different Varieties of Rosa
Rose hips are pseudo-fruits from the plants of the Rosa genus in the Rosaceae family. Rosa genus
contains around 100 species which are widely spread across Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North
America [16]. In Europe, the most abundant and most studied is the Rosa canina species which is
a native shrub [17]. The pseudo-fruits from Rosa species have been used both for alimentation and
for medicinal purposes thanks to their high level content of bioactive compounds. They are known
to have a high level of antioxidant and antimicrobial action [18]. Their antioxidant activity is due
to their content in polyphenols, vitamins C, E, B and carotenoids and these compounds may have
synergistic effects. Rose hips also have an anti-inﬂammatory action, as well as anti-diabetic and
anticancer effects [19–21].
2.2.1. Hydrosoluble Antioxidants
Among the hydrosoluble phytochemicals contained in rose hips, phenolic compounds and
ascorbic acid stand out [22–25]. The inclusion of ascorbic acid in diet is important as it provides redox
status and produces health beneﬁts. Harrison [26] found a beneﬁcial impact from this vitamin in
cognitive decline and Alzheimer´s disease. The concentration of this vitamin in rose hips depends on
several factors and has a wide range of concentration. Thus, Czyzowska et al. [27] found 1200 mg/L in
Rosa rugosa and 600 mg/L in Rosa canina. Jiménez et al. [21] found 101 mg of vitamin C/Kg of dry fruit
in Rosa canina rose hips. This concentration was six times higher than that found by Tumbas et al. [14]
in rose hips of Rosa canina from Serbia. However, it was lower than those found by Demir et al. [15] in
Rosa canina, Rosa dumalis and Rosa gallica, from Turkey and from those found by Türkben et al. [28] in
Rosa canina, also from Turkey. Phenolic compounds are synthesized in plants through the carbohydrates
and are generally produced as a defence mechanism of the plants against pathogens and as a protection
against an excess of ultraviolet radiation. These compounds are secondary metabolites of the plants
and are characterized by at least one aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl groups attached.
Ellagic acid showed anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic action in different assays both in vivo and
in vitro [29]. This compound can act as an antioxidant, and it has also been able to induce apoptosis
in carcinogenic cells [30]. Quercetin is the most abundant ﬂavonoid that accumulates in superior
plants where it forms glycosides, such as rutin, with a great variety of sugars [31]. Quercetin and
its derivative quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, inhibit ROS overproduction making chemoprotection of
mitochondrial function through antioxidative actions [32]. Tumbas et al. [14] found that Rosa canina
rose hips from Serbia showed high concentrations of vitamin C, quercetin and ellagic acid. These
results coincide with those of Hosni et al. [33] who observed that quercetin and ellagic acid were the
most abundant phenolic compounds in Tunisian rose hips. Fujii and Saito [34] found that, among
other compounds isolated from Rosa canina rose hips, quercetin was a potent melanogenesis inhibitor
in B16 mouse melanoma cells. The inhibition of melanogenesis by quercetin was due to the inhibition
of both tyrosinase activity and of the protein expression. Conceição de Oliveira et al. [35] reported
that a high intake of quercetin was associated with a lower risk of suffering from diabetes type II.
Ouerghemmi et al. [36] found that Rosa canina extracts includes two phenolic compounds derivatives
of kaempferol (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and kaempferol-7-O-glucoside). Ercisli et al. [13] studied
the chemical composition of the fruits from Rosa canina, Rosa dumalis subsp. antalyensis, Rosa dumalis
subsp. boissiere, Rosa villosa, Rosa pulverulenta and Rosa pisiformis. In this study, it was observed that
the highest total phenolic content corresponded to Rosa canina (96 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry
weight) and Rosa pulverulenta (94 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight), whereas the largest content
of ascorbic acid corresponded to Rosa dumalis subsp. boissiere (943 mg ascorbic acid/100 mL) and to

4 of 37
Rosa pulverulenta (923 mg ascorbic acid/100 mL). The authors of this study concluded that native rose
genotypes are extremely rich in phenols and ascorbic acid and so could be used as functional food or
as a food additive. More recently, Demir et al. [15] studied the quantity of phenolic compounds and
antioxidant activities of ﬁve different rose hip (Rosa L.) species including Rosa canina, Rosa dumalis,
Rosa gallica, Rosa dumalis subsp. boissiere and Rosa hirtissima grown in Turkey. They found that the
greatest amount of phenolic compounds corresponded to Rosa dumalis subsp. boissiere (52.94 mg gallic
acid/g dry weight) and that the rest of them showed very similar concentrations of around 30 mg
gallic acid/g dry weight. As for the concentration of individual phenolic compounds, those authors
found a high concentration of catechin, procyanidin B2 and epicatechin gallate in Rosa dumalis subsp
boissiere. Aladedunye et al. [37] found that the major phenolic compounds of Rosa woodsii fruit extracts
were gallic acid, catechin and quercetin, which coincides with the results of Abdel-Hameed et al. [38]
in Rosa damascena extracts. In Figure 1 are shown the chemical formulas of the most important phenolic
compounds present in rose hips.
Figure 1. Chemical formulas of hydrosoluble phenolic compounds of rose hips.
In addition, some studies have been made comparing the concentration of bioactive compounds
in rose hips with that of other vegetables of interest to alimentation and to the food industry.
Öztürk et al. [39] compared phenolic acid content in sour cherry juice, rose hips tea, green tea

and tomato and found that rose hip tea contained a greater quantity of phenolic acids than
the rest of the products. Rose hips contained vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid in
important concentrations, while green tea had high concentrations of syringic acid. Denev et al. [40]
studied the concentration of major polyphenol and anthocyanin contents of fruit extract and the
antioxidant properties of six fruits: rose hip (Rosa canina), rowanberry (Serbus aucuparia), hawthorn
(Crataegus monogyna), chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum), and blueberry
(Vaccinium myrtillus). They found that rose hips had chlorogenic acid but in lower concentrations
than rowanberry and chokeberry, and that the rose fruit showed a high concentration of rutin but
no anthocyanins were found. As for the antioxidative properties of these six fruits, rose hip extract
showed the highest antioxidant activity via Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC), Total
Peroxyl Radical Trapping Potential (TRAP) and Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity (HORAC) assay,
while blueberry extract was the most potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. These results were similar
to those found by Halvorsen et al. [41] who studied the concentration of total antioxidants by the
Ferric-Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) assay in different dietary plants (fruits, berries, vegetables,
cereals, nuts and pulses), ﬁnding that vegetables that contain most antioxidants included members of
several families, such as Rosaceae (dog rose, sour cherry, blackberry, strawberry, raspberry).
In some research studies, the composition of other parts of the rose as distinct from the rose
hips has also been studied. Guimarăes et al. [42] studied the composition of petals, fertilized ﬂowers,
unripe hips, ripening hips and overripe hips from the Rosa micrantha from Portugal. These authors
found that fertilized ﬂowers showed the highest concentration of total phenolic compounds (527.07 mg
GAE/g extract) followed by the petals (424.20 mg GAE/g extract), and that the different hips showed
much lower concentrations. A similar study was carried out by Barros et al. [43] in which they made
an evaluation of the antioxidant properties (DPPH radical scavenging effects, reducing power, and
inhibition of β-carotene, inhibition of lipid peroxidation) of Rosa canina hips seed, petals, ﬂowers and
galls. They found that galls proved to have the greatest antioxidant activity, ripen hips showed the
highest content of tocopherols and β-carotene, unripe hips gave the highest levels of ascorbic acid and
petals had the highest concentration of sugars.
2.2.2. Lipid-Soluble Antioxidants
In addition to the hydrosoluble antioxidants, in Rosa species there are also lipid-soluble
antioxidants such as carotenoids and tocopherols, although these compounds have been less studied
and knowledge is more limited than in other bioactive substances. The distinct orange to red colour
of rose hips is formed as a result of various carotenoids. The most abundant of these is β-carotene
and lycopene, followed by β-cryptoxanthin, rubixanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein [44–46]. Carotenoids
are very important in the human diet as they act as provitamin A and can prevent certain chronic
diseases and even cancer [47]. Tocopherols, α-, β-, γ-, and δ-isomers, and tocotrienols have vitamin
E activity and they are compounds with ability to scavenge free radicals, and even tocopherols can
be considered as the most important natural antioxidants. Several authors [48–50] have shown that
these antioxidants have beneﬁcial effects in degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer´s
disease, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Fromm et al. [51] studied seed oils
from different Rosaceae species such as dessert and cider apples (Malus domestica Borkh.), quince
(Cydonia oblonga Mill.) and rose hip (Rosa canina L.). In this study, it was found that qualitative and
quantitative composition of tocopherols and carotenoids differed signiﬁcantly between different genera
and also among cultivars of the same species. Total content of tocopherols of the rose seed oils analysed
ranged from 597.7 mg/kg from one sample of quince to 1099.9 mg/kg of rose hip. Andersson et al. [46]
studied the concentration of tocopherol and tocotrienol in four different species of Rosa (Rosa dumalis,
Rosa rubiginosa, Rosa spinosissima, Rosa pimpinellifolia) and only found α- and γ-tocopherol in the ﬂeshy
parts of the rose hips. Tocopherol content and vitamin E activity varied depending on the date of
harvesting, species and year, while the fruit ripening had little inﬂuence on this activity. In Figure 2
the chemical formulas are shown of the most important lipid-soluble compounds present in rose hips.

2.3. Presence of Other Active Compounds in Rose Hips
Although most of the time when speaking of the pseudofruits from the different Rosa species,
reference is made to their content of vitamin C and antioxidants, there are also other important
bioactive compounds in rose hips. For a long time the residue products from rose hips have been
used as animal fodder, but nowadays these residue products are gaining in importance as they can
be used in cosmetics, pharmacology and in food applications as they contain oil with a high degree
of unsaturated lipids. The quantity of oil contained in the seeds depends on the species and ranges
from 5 to 18%. In rose hip, seed oil 97% corresponds to linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acid; the
remaining 3% is made up of 12 minority fatty acids [52]. Grajzer et al. [53] and Kazaz et al. [54] found
that the content of linoleic acid is approximately 40–56% of seed oil, α-linoleic and its derivatives
between 20–30% and oleic acid 14–20%. Rose hip seed oil has been used in cosmetics because of
its therapeutic effect on skin disorders [55]. In addition, Szentmihalyi et al. [56] compared various
methods to extract oil from rose hips, traditional solvent extraction, by ultrasound and microwave
sub- and supercritical ﬂuid extraction. Unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid) were
extracted to a maximum of between 35.9–54.7% using microwave and polyunsaturated fatty acid
(linoleic and linolenic acid) were found between 60% and 90% in the recovered oils.
Likewise,
some
galactolipids
were
isolated
from
Rosa
canina
hips.
Galactolipids
(monogalactosyldiacylglycerols and digalactosyldiacylglycerol) are compounds that accumulate
in the plasma membrane of the plants, and distinguishes them from the lipidic composition of
the cell membranes of animals and fungi [57]. Most galactolipids possess fatty acids with high
levels of unsaturation.
α-linolenic acid can range as high as 90% of the total fatty acids [58].
Lopes et al. [20] found that some galactolipids had an anti-inﬂammatory action and Maeda et al. [59,60]
found that these compounds have anti-tumorigenic roles.
Larsen et al. [61] and Cohen [62]
isolated the (2S)-1,2-di-O-[(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoyl]-3-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl glycerol
from dried and milled fruits of Rosa canina by bioassay-guided fractionation (Figure 3).
Christensen [63] isolated the galactolypid 1,2-di-O-α-linolenoyl-3-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol
from Rosa canina hips. Hou et al. [64] found that bioactive glyceroglycolipid 1,2-di-O-α-linolenoyl-3-O-
β-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol (dLGG) that was identiﬁed from C. rabens was found in vitro and

in vivo to be a potent nitric oxide (NO) scavenger. dLGG treatment inhibited both mRNA and protein
expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in murine macrophages and
inhibited COX-2 gene transcription in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated B16 cells.
Figure 3. Chemical formula of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol of rose hips.
There is also some research work where extracts from rose hips have different pharmaceutical
actions but the chemical composition of these extracts was not studied. Thus, McCutcheon et al. [65]
examined a hundred extracts obtained in methanol from plants in order to determine the antiviral
activity against seven virus. It was found that twelve extracts had antiviral activity at non cytotoxic
concentrations. The extracts of Rosa nutkunu and Amelunchier alnifoliu, both members of the Rosaceae,
were found to be very active against an enteric coronavirus. Orhan et al. [66] also found in vivo
anti-inﬂammatory and antinociceptive activity from aqueous crude extract, ethanol extract and from
different fractions obtained from these earlier extracts of Rosa canina L. fruits.
Dogan et al. [67] studied the seed mineral contents of different rose hip species (Rosa canina L.,
Rosa dumalis subsp. boissiere, Rosa iberica, Rosa heckeliana subsp. vanheurckiana and Rosa pulverulenta).
Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium contents of the investigated species varied from 19.039 to
28.076 ppm (N), from 553 to 1080 ppm (P), and from 1142 to 2945 ppm (K). Nickel, lead, and sulphur
contents of the investigated species ranged from 13.5 to 190.2 ppm, from 0.35 to 4.35 ppm, from 609.5 to
1152.5 ppm, respectively. Likewise, other minerals present in lesser concentration were also analysed
such as sodium, iron, manganese, zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium. The mineral contents of
these species ranked from the highest to lowest as N > K > P > S > Mg > Ca > Na > Fe > Zn > Ni > Mn
> Cu > Pb.
2.4. Factors Affecting the Concentration of Bioactive Compounds in Rose Hips. Utilization of These Compounds
in Agro-Food Industry
Different factors could have an inﬂuence on the content of phytochemicals in rose hips. From the
results of several studies, it would seem that there is quite a range of variability, especially in
the concentration of vitamin C and this could be due to the ascorbic acid instability. Dogan and
Kazankaya [68] found that the variability in the content of vitamin C of rose hips depends on the
geographical origin of the plant, the species and ecological factors. Roman et al. [25] found that the
content of vitamin C of rose hips depends on the quantity of light received by the plant and the oxygen
level of the environment. Likewise, many factors could affect the vitamin C content of rose hips,
and the fruit freshness level seems to be one of the most important ones. Strålsjö et al. [69] found
that dried rose hips had less ascorbic acid content than fresh rose hips. More recently, Baiano and
del Nobile [70] concluded that the quantity of vitamin C in vegetables depends on several factors
such as the plant variety, soil condition, climate, the length of time since it had been picked and
storage. Türkben et al. [28] found that quercetin and (+)-catechin were the main phenolic compounds
in Rosa canina rose hips but their concentrations were very variable depending on the level of ripeness
of the fruits as well as processing conditions and manipulation techniques. Demir et al. [15] found
that catechin concentration was notable in different Rosa species from Turkey, and it depended on
geographical origin and ecological factors (light, temperature, or soil nutrients) just as in the case


--- Page 8 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
8 of 37
of vitamin C. Likewise, they also found a high variability in phenolic acids such as vanillic acid,
caffeic acid and protocatechuic acid. Cunja et al. [71] found that frost stimulates the formation of
β-carotene and lycopene in Rosa canina hips but that it reduces the concentration of ascorbic acid
and some quercetin glycosides. Likewise, they found that antioxidant ability decreased in frostbitten
rose hips. Similarty, studies carried out in our laboratory have compared nutraceutical compounds
(vitamin C, neutral phenols and acidic phenols) content of four Rosa species rose hips: Rosa pouzinii,
Rosa corymbifera, Rosa glauca and Rosa canina coming from different geographical zones of Spain with
different climatology that can condition fruit characteristics. Results showed a great quantitative
variability in ascorbic acid and neutral phenols content, and quantitative and qualitative differences in
acidic phenols content, depending on the species. A great correlation between freshness of the rose
hips and concentration of neutral polyphenols was found. Signiﬁcant differences were found in the
acidic phenols content among the studied species [72].
Because of their rich composition in bioactive compounds, rose hips have meant an important
source of food and medicine for many cultures and currently they are being used in the development
of functional foods or to improve the stability and conservation of some foods. Thus, it has been
observed that the addition of Rosa canina rose hips as a functional ingredient in porcine frankfurters
acts as a partial substitute for sodium nitrate. This is important since it means that the concentration of
this additive could be lowered [73]. It has also been observed that the phenolic compounds of rose hip
are useful for preventing or delaying oxidation in very saturated oils such as canola oil (Brassica sp.).
Aladedunye et al. [37] studied the composition and antioxidant activity of Rosa woodsii extracts, and
how this phenolic extract acted on canola oil. On studying the efﬁciency of these phenolic extracts
in protecting canola oil from thermal deterioration, it was found that after 7 days, the formation of
lipid hydroperoxides was 2.5 times higher in the control canola oil compared to the fortiﬁed sample
with Rosa woodsii extract. Romero et al. [74] compared the effect of adding α-tocopherol, α-tocotrienol
and Moscheta rose (Rosa rubiginosa) shell extract to canola oil at high temperature (180 ◦C) in order
to determine how it acted on the stability of this saturated fat. From the results, it was found that
the addition of Rosa rubiginosa shell extract gave great stability to canola oil. Rosa rubiginosa shell
extract had 825 µg/mL of α-tocopherol. Utrera et al. [75] examined the effect of frozen storage and
the addition of a phenolic-rich dog rose extracts (Rosa canina L.) on lipid and protein oxidation of beef
patties. Protein oxidation was determined by measuring tryptophan loss and the formation of speciﬁc
lysine oxidation products: α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS), α-aminoadipic acid (AAA), and Schiff
bases. The addition of Rosa canina extract inhibited the formation of AAS, AAA and had an antioxidant
effect on tryptophan oxidation while it promoted the formation of Schiff bases and incremented the
hardness of beef patties.
3. Rose Hip and Disease
The use of traditional medicine is still deep ingrained in some cultures even today; therefore
thousands of people rely on the therapeutic potential of plants for treating certain diseases in their daily
lives [76–79]. Beneﬁts from of this kind of therapy are not unexpected, since natural products have
always been an ample source of new medical compounds [80]. Due to its phytochemical composition,
rose hip is an interesting therapeutic option for those disorders which involve oxidative stress and/or
a pro-inﬂammatory status.
3.1. Anticancer Activity
Cancer onset and progression is closely related to the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). ROS-induced damage in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA produces mutations responsible for
tumour apparition, while lesions in other cellular components such as proteins or lipids contribute
to maintaining cancerous phenotype [81]. Moreover, cancer cells are known for their abnormally
increased ROS levels, due to the role of these molecules in cell proliferation. In order to avoid oxidative
stress damage, antioxidant systems of tumour cells are also increased. Consequently, redox balance

in cancer is quite delicate and its disruption triggers cell death. Therefore, many chemotherapy
strategies are focused on a redox balance rupture [82,83]. Since medicinal plants are a natural source of
antioxidant compounds, many studies highlight the effectiveness of a wide variety of plants against
cancer [84].
The role of rose hip in cancer treatment has been widely tested among a wide variety of cancer
cell lines, and promising results have been obtained in most cases. As the antitumor potential of rose
hip is supposed to be a consequence of its phytochemical composition, which may vary attending to
the factors described above, quite different results have been obtained by researchers from distinct
regions even when they work with the very same rose variety.
The anticancer properties of Rosa canina have been evaluated in various cancer cell lines as shown
in Table 1 [14,21,85]. All groups found signiﬁcant decreases in cell viability after incubating these
cancer cell lines with whole rose hip extract or with puriﬁed fractions of its most relevant components
(vitamin C and neutral and/or acid phenolic compounds). This antiproliferative effect may be related
to the antioxidant properties of these extracts. According to Jiménez et al. [21] the incubation of
Caco-2 cell line with rose hip fractions resulted in a dramatic decrease in ROS levels. Furthermore, the
fractions with the highest antioxidant activity—namely neutral and acid phenolic compounds—were
also the ones with the greatest antiproliferative effect. Moreover, Guimarães et al. [85] proved
that antiproliferative effects of Rosa canina extracts were mainly due to their phenolic content, as
non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds enriched extracts showed greater antioxidant activity and
provided higher GI50 values than anthocyanins enriched extracts. Some tumours present a reactive
oxygen-driven phenotype, which means they use the ROS produced by the Warburg phenomenon as
signalling molecules. Patients suffering from these glycolytic tumours, which usually tend to have a
poor prognosis, are the most likely candidates to beneﬁt from antioxidant therapy [85,86].
However, Tumbas et al. [14] and Guimarães et al. [85] also noticed that incubation of some rose
hip extracts with breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) led to an increase in cell viability. They suggest that
their content in isoﬂavone phytoestrogens may stimulate the growth of oestrogen-dependent cells like
MCF-7 are [87]. So in conclusion, the therapeutic use of Rosa canina may be limited to glycolytic cancer
and should be avoided in oestrogen-dependent tumours in order not to promote cancer growth.
Anticancer activity of rose hip is not always linked to its antioxidant properties. Antiproliferative
effects of extracts from Rosa canina leaves were observed on myeloblastic leukaemia cell model
(HL60 cells) and to a lesser extent on myelomonocytic leukaemia model (U937 cells), alone or combined
with other plant extracts [88]. Incubation with plant extracts resulted in an upregulation of vitamin D
receptor and retinoid X receptor, accompanied by an increase in the transcriptional activity of this
receptor complex. Results from Zhamanbayeva et al. [87] suggest that some phytochemicals contained
in Rosa canina could mimic the mechanism of action of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 analogues tested in
clinical trials against myeloid leukaemia; these compounds show an intense differentiation-inducing
activity [89,90].

Lee et al. [91] found that Rosa rugosa extracts inhibited human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP
growth due to its anti-histone acetyltransferase activity. Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent
transcription factor which acts as a key molecule for prostate cancer proliferation. Histone acetylation
regulates the transcription of AR-related genes [92], so many anti-prostate cancer drugs are designed to

interrupt this process [93]. By inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity, Rosa rugosa extracts repressed
the androgen receptor-mediated transcription and as a consequence induced cell death. Moreover,
co-administration of Rosa rugosa extracts and ﬂutamide—an androgen receptor antagonist commonly
used in prostate cancer chemotherapy— resulted in a higher transcription blocking. This synergy
effect demonstrates that Rosa rugosa extracts may have a promising future in therapy alone or as an
adjuvant [91]. Nevertheless, it is still not clear if this anti-histone acetylation activity is due to the
action of a particular compound, as yet unidentiﬁed, or if it is a result of the combination of various
phytochemical compounds. Further research in this ﬁeld is required.
Rosa roxburghii is another traditional medicinal plant with antitumor properties.
Firstly,
Liu et al. [94] observed that, in combination with Fagopyrum cymosum, extracts from Rosa roxburghii
induced intrinsic apoptosis on human oesophageal squamous carcinoma (CaEs-17), human gastric
carcinoma (SGC-7901) and pulmonary carcinoma (A549). Then, Chen et al. [95] found that crude
polysaccharides extracted from Rosa roxburghii induced strong cytotoxicity on epithelial ovarian cancer
A2780 cell line and reduced cell migration, revealing the potential therapeutic use of Rosa roxburghii
for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer. Regarding the underlying mechanism of action,
Chen et al. observed that incubation with crude polysaccharides led to a decreased expression
of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9). MMP-9 is a proteolytic enzyme upregulated in certain tumours,
including ovarian cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis due to its capacity in degrading
some components of the extracellular matrix and hence in promoting metastasis [96]. Although the
mechanism by which crude polysaccharides from Rosa roxburghii reduce MMP-9 expression remains
unknown, other studies using polysaccharides extracted from Inonotus obliquus revealed that the
transcription of MMP-9 was disrupted via RNA transcription factors, as NF-κB signalling pathway
was inhibited [97].
3.2. Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease that affects 22.7% of the adult US
population. This condition can strike people of all ages and sexes, but it is most commonly seen
between the ages of 20 and 50, and the prevalence is higher in women (23.9%) than in men (18.6%) [98].
RA is a systemic inﬂammatory disease that usually affects the lining of the joints (synovial
membrane), leading to erosions of the cartilage and deformity of bone and joints. In some cases,
joint inﬂammation can be accompanied by generalized systemic symptoms, as well as inﬂammatory
involvement of non-articular organs. Nowadays, the causes of RA remain unknown, and several
etiologic mechanisms have been proposed. Although it seems clear that autoimmune disorders play
an important role in this disease, other endocrine, metabolic and nutritional factors can also contribute
to this pathology [99,100].
Nowadays, there is no effective therapy for RA. Different combinations of non-steroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic
agents are used for the treatment of symptoms. However, new drugs are needed since some patients do
not respond successfully and the traditional treatments cause serious side effects in others. As a result,
in recent years, different researchers have focused their interest in the study of traditional treatments
for RA with the aim of discovering new active compounds present in natural plant extract that could
constitute the base for some new drugs for RA treatment (Table 2).
Rose hip, and in particular dog rose (Rosa canina L., Rosaceae) have traditionally been used
for the prevention and therapy of RA [101]. In particular, rose hip powder has been shown to
reduce symptoms associated with rheumatoid inﬂammation in clinical trials [62,102–104]. This effect
is related to its high content in anti-inﬂammatory molecules, such as the galactolipid GOPO
(1,2-di-O-α-linolenoyl-3-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol) [60], which can reduce chemotaxis
of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, as well as
diminish the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein produced in the liver in response to
inﬂammation [102,105]. Moreover, rose hips have been shown to reduce the production of several key


--- Page 11 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
11 of 37
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, (IFN)-γ, IL-12) and chemokines CCL5 (RANTES),
IP-10 (CXCL10) [106–108].
On the other hand, several fatty acids present in rose hips, such as triterpenoic acids, ursolic acid,
oleanolic acid and betulinic acid among others, have been shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)
1 and 2 activity. COX expression facilitates the invasion of synovial ﬁbroblasts in joints of RA patients
and the accumulation of advanced glycation end products. The inhibition of COX contributes towards
reducing inﬂammation in RA patients, and can be responsible for a part of the clinically observed
effect [109,110].
The inﬂammatory process triggered by RA has been also associated with an increased
generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which contribute to tissue damage.
In consequence, antioxidant nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, polyphenols and
antioxidant enzymes could play a signiﬁcant role in the protection against the damaging effects of
ROS/RNS produced in RA [100]. It has been shown that lipophilic extracts and polyphenols from rose
hips reduce the production of ROS and inhibit NO release from macrophages [107,111]. Moreover,
total ﬂavonoids from rose hips protect against cell apoptosis, DNA and mitochondrial H2O2-induced
damage as well as amyloid beta peptide-induced oxidative injury [21,112,113].
Another alteration commonly found in RA patients consists of a dysregulation of Nuclear
Factor (NF-κB) signaling pathway. NF-κB regulates a vast variety of biological processes including
immunity, inﬂammation, and apoptosis. In RA, the imbalanced production of pro-inﬂammatory
mediators and oxidative damage promote a chronic activation of NF-κB pathway, which results in
inﬂammation, hyperplasia and tissue destruction [114]. As a result, the inhibition of NF-κB constitutes
a potential target for RA. In this context, several members from the Rosa spp. have shown inhibitory
actions on NF-κB related inﬂammatory responses. For instance, phytosterols present in Rosa spp.,
such as, β-sitosterol, attenuates the phosphorylation of NF-κB in TNF-α-stimulated human endothelial
cells [115]. Phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid, re-establishes the association of IκBα with NF-κB,
hampering the capacity of NF-κB to bind DNA [116], while astragalin and tormentic acid inhibit IkBα
phosphorylation and degradation as well as NF-κB nuclear translocation [111,117].
Besides inﬂammation, RA patients suffer from abnormal bone destruction caused by an abnormal
activation of osteoclast. Osteoclast differentiation is dependent on cytokines and membrane-bound
factors expressed by T cells. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is one of the major
osteoclastogenic cytokines.
When the ligand binds to RANK, IκBα kinase (IKK), NF-κB, and
nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasm 1 (NFATc1) are sequentially activated, leading to
osteoclastogenesis [118]. Aqueous extract of rose hip has been found to inhibit the activation of
NF-κB mediated by RANKL and slow down the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and hence it
could constitute a bioactive molecule against bone destruction in RA [119].
Consequently, thanks to its composition in bioactive molecules, different members of Rosa genus
have proved to have analgesic and anti-inﬂammatory actions in different pain and inﬂammatory
animal models of RA [120].

3.3. Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by a decrease in bone mass and strength, as well
as an alteration of bone microarchitecture. The main consequence of this disease is an increase in the
risk of developing bone fractures especially of the hip and vertebrae [121].
In bone, ROS play a dual role. Under physiological conditions, the production of ROS by
osteoclasts facilitates destruction of calciﬁed tissue, assisting in bone remodelling. Additionally, in
bone fractures, the interaction between collagen strand and the mineral phase generates large amounts
of ROS which may facilitate bone healing [122]. However, an enhanced osteoclastic activity may
increase the superoxide anion generation and inhibit superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase
activities, triggering oxidative stress [123]. This abnormal increase of oxidants can over-activate
different proteolytic enzymes, such as neutrophil elastases or metal proteinases, promoting the
oxidative damage of bone extracellular matrix, with a consequent alteration of cell metabolism and
viability [122]. Therefore, antioxidant supplementation can contribute to restoring Bone Mineral
Density (BMD) by regulating the levels of oxidative stress.
In a ovariectomized rat model of
post-menopausal osteoporosis, antioxidants contained in blueberries reduced femoral mRNA levels of
alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase as well as the levels of serum
mRNA of osteocalcin. This treatment also reduced loss of whole-body BMD and prevented the loss of
tibial and femoral BMD [124]. Extracts of Rosa spp. has a similar phytochemical proﬁle to blueberries,
characterized by a high content in antioxidants and consequently, they could also play an important
role in preventing osteoporosis [125].
On the other hand, antioxidants play a key role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation.
For instance, ascorbic acid (AA), is a cofactor required for hydroxylation and secretion of procollagen,
and for the formation of the stable-triple-helical collagen, molecule needed for the correct growing
and maturation of both connective and bone tissue [126]. Moreover, AA can potentially bind putative
antioxidant-responsive elements (ARE) contained in many of osteoblastic and osteocitic genes, such as
osterix, and induce their expression, stimulating Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMMSC) to
differentiate into osteoblast [127]. However, no study has yet showed this activity by Rosa spp. extracts.
Several studies have demonstrated that natural antioxidant supplementation including
polyphenols reduce bone loss caused by oxidative stress [128]. As a result, Rosa canina, thanks
to its high content in antioxidants, constitute a potential treatment for osteoporosis by reducing the
damage caused by an excess of ROS in bone tissue, and by increasing bone formation through the
synthesis of collagen matrix and the stimulation osteoblast differentiation [124,125].
3.4. Diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is a group of physiological dysfunctions characterized by hyperglycemia
resulting directly from inadequate insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or excessive glucagon secretion.
Diabetes mellitus has been classiﬁed in two types: Type 1 diabetes (T1D)—an autoimmune disorder
that provoke the destruction of pancreatic β-cells and Type 2 diabetes (T2D)—an alteration in glucose
regulation due to a combination of dysfunctional pancreatic β cells and insulin resistance [129].
Nowadays, diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disorder and its incidence is rising year
by year [130].
Several studies have demonstrated that the overproduction of ROS has a key role in the severity
of diabetes complications. In diabetic patients, hyperglycemia induces overproduction of superoxide
by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain, which increases hexosamine pathway ﬂux, enhances
the formation of advanced glycosylation end products and activates protein kinase C. Moreover, ROS
also enhance nitric oxide generation favoring peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant which damages DNA.
DNA damage activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and consequently reduces
the levels of NAD+, a subtract for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Depletion of NAD+ slows the rate of
glycolysis, electron transport, and ATP formation, and produces an ADP-ribosylation of the GAPDH.
These processes result in acute endothelial dysfunction that also contributes to the development of


--- Page 14 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
14 of 37
diabetic complications [131]. Several antidiabetic drugs, as well as the natural antioxidant vitamin E,
have been administrated in medical practices. However, prevention of secondary complications turned
out to be insufﬁcient, and in some cases, side effects associated with the treatment prevented their use.
In consequence, new therapeutic approaches are needed [130] [132]. In this context rose hip, due to its
high content in antioxidants, could constitute a potential adjuvant therapy for diabetes mellitus.
One of the main causes of diabetes mellitus is the deﬁciency of pancreatic β-cell viability and
performance. Rosa canina extract with the concentration of 0.001 mg/mL signiﬁcantly increased
proliferation of βTC6 cell line compared with control cells.
These results were supported by
Orhan et al. [133], who found that R-H2O fraction of Rosa canina fruits reduced blood glucose
level signiﬁcantly in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (50–62%) and demonstrated the
hypoglycemic effect of Rosa canina in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. Moreover, histopathological
studies of organs from STZ-induced diabetic rats revealed that low doses of Rosa canina extract
(250 mg/kg body weight) signiﬁcantly increased the number of islets in comparison with diabetic
rats of the control group and improved the histology of necrotic islets of pancreas [134]. This effect
was not associated with the phenolic content Rosa canina—which is mainly contained in ethanol and
methanol extracts—but with different bioactive compounds such as vitamin B and C, carotene, organic
acids, ﬂavonoids, tannins, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and pectins contained in the polar
extract [135]. For their part, Can et al. [136] demonstrated that the aqueous and ethanol extracts of
Rosa canina fruits had no hypoglycemic activity in normal rabbits. However, despite the potential of
rose hip extract on improvement of cell proliferation, it does not avoid DNA damage and consequently
it is not able to prevent the reduction of β-cell viability associated with the glucotoxicity seen in
diabetes mellitus type 2 [137].
In diabetes, hyperglycaemia is also associated with more glycogenesis and less glycogen
production, so reduction of glucose uptake in liver could ameliorate the complications of diabetes.
Rose hip extract was not able to modify glucose uptake in the hepatic cell line HepG2. Nevertheless,
in high fat diet models, rose hip extracts down regulated the hepatic lipogenic program, resulting in
a reduction of >50% of the hepatic lipids, and a consequent improvement in insulin sensibility and
glucose toleration, as well as a reduction of plasma cholesterol levels. The mechanisms underlying
these effects remain unknown and further investigations are needed [46].
Another therapeutic approach for diabetes type 2 consists in delaying the production or absorption
of glucose by inhibiting carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase to
decrease postprandial hyperglycaemia [138]. In vitro models of glucose absorption revealed that rose
hip extracts were not able to alter glucose diffusion [137]. Nevertheless, rose hip extracts, and garlic
acid contained in them among other molecules, can inhibit both enzymes. The inhibition of α-amylase
is lower than the repression on α-glucosidase activity. As a result, sugars can be degraded into smaller
carbohydrates passing through gastrointestinal tract without undesirable microbial fermentation,
but, as α-glucosidase activity is highly repressed, rapid glucose release to bloodstream is prevented,
contributing to the regulation of blood sugar level [9]. The molecules responsible for these effects have
not been identiﬁed and further studies are needed in this ﬁeld.
3.5. Hyperlipidaemia
Hyperlipidaemia is a condition consisting of elevated plasma cholesterol and/or triglyceride
levels. Hyperlipidaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), high
risk of developing premature coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercoagulability, hyperinsulinemia,
insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance pancreatitis [139].
Niominya et al. [140] demonstrated that 80% aqueous acetone extracts from the fruit
(50 mg/kg/day and seeds (12.5 and 25 mg/kg/day) of Rosa canina signiﬁcantly reduced plasma
triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels after 14 days of treatment in mice. The main bioactive
compound of this extract is trans-tiliroside, whose administration signiﬁcantly reduced liver TG
levels, and tended to diminish FFA levels, but not signiﬁcantly. Niominya et al. also found that


--- Page 15 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
15 of 37
trans-tiliroside increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α)
mRNA levels in liver tissue 24 h after single oral administration [140]. PPAR-α is a transcription factor
that induce the expression of PPAR-acyl-CoA oxidase gene and therefore lead to reduced FA substrate
for TG synthesis [141]. Although more profound studies should be made, these results suggest that the
anti-lypidemic effect of Rosa canina could be based on its capacity to promote the lipid metabolism [140].
These results were also conﬁrmed by Taghizadeh et al. (2016) who found that the administration
of Rosa canina extract in STZ-induced diabetic rats at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight signiﬁcantly
decreased the levels of serum triglycerides whereas serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and
high-density lipoprotein levels were not modiﬁed [134].
On the other hand, GC-MS analysis of seed oil from several species of rose hip revealed a high
content in polyunsaturated fatty acid ω-3 and ω-6 (45.38–54.58% linoleic acid (ω-6), 13.67–24.75%
alpha linolenic acid (ω-3), 20.83% oleic acid (ω-9), 12.97% palmitic acid, 8.54% stearic acid, and 1.99%
arachidonic acid [142]. The results obtained revealed that the oil from the seeds of rose hip contains
polyunsaturated fatty acids ω-3 and ω-6 which decrease TG levels. The mechanisms underlying this
reduction of plasma TG levels are complex. On the one hand, polyunsaturated fatty acid, such as
the ones contained in rose hip extracts, prevent the binding of the LXR/RR heterodimer to the
regulatory regions LXREs contained in SREBP-1c promoter, and consequently, reduce the expression of
SREBP-1c [143]. SREBP-1c is a transcription factor with a key role in the control of hepatic lipogenesis.
Suppression of SREBP-1c expression results in a reduction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and FA synthase,
resulting in a decrease in FA synthesis. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease the activity of
key enzymes in TG biosynthesis, such as phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase or diacylglycerol (DG)
acyltransferase that catalyses phosphatidate to DG and DG to TG, respectively. Secondary to a decrease
in TG synthesis, polyunsaturated fatty acid can also inhibit the synthesis and release of decrease
hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG. On the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids can
suppress the expression of hepatic lipase and Apo CIII and increase Apo CII and VLDL-receptor [144].
3.6. Obesity
Obesity rates have experienced such a great increase over these last years that it is now considered
to be global epidemic. Changes in diet and lifestyle are the major causes for this increase in incidence
and the consequences of obesity include a wide range of disorders, from diabetes to cancer [145–147].
In this context, prevention of obesity would contribute towards avoiding all its related diseases, with
a resulting improvement in the quality-of-life for many thousands of people worldwide. Obesity
can be basically classiﬁed as an inﬂammatory process, since adipocytes dysfunction results in an
increased production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [148]. Due to the anti-inﬂammatory properties of
some phytochemicals contained in medicinal plants, it is reasonable to suppose that they could play a
therapeutic role in obesity [117,149].
Focusing on the potential benefits of rose hip for obesity prevention, Ninomiya et al. [140] reported the
anti-obesity properties of trans-tiliroside (kaempferol 3-O-(6′′-p-coumaroyl)-β-glucoside), a glycosidic
ﬂavonoid contained in Rosa canina. Administration of rose hip extracts of trans-tiliroside alone to rat
models resulted in a reduction in overweight and liver fat accumulation. Furthermore, lipid metabolism
was found to increase after trans-tiliroside administration, since peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor α (PPARα) was overexpressed. PPARα decreases lipid levels, as its activation promotes fatty
acids oxidation, and the use of PPARα agonists ameliorate obesity-related side effects [150].
Nagatomo et al. [151] delved into the effect of Rosa canina trans-tiliroside in obesity. They observed that
both Rosa canina extract and trans-tiliroside were able to prevent lipid accumulation in differentiated
adipocytes cell model. On mouse models, both conditions led to a decrease in body weight. Finally,
they found a signiﬁcant decrease in PPARγ expression after Rosa canina extract administration. As
PPARα, PPARγ is implicated in lipid homeostasis, as well as being involved in adipogenesis and in
insulin sensitivity control [150]. Taken together with the previous discovers of Ninomiya et al. [140],


--- Page 16 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
16 of 37
results from Nagatomo et al. [151] show that trans-tiliroside anti-obese effects are related to an increase
in lipid metabolism linked to a decrease in adipogenesis.
Arising from these ﬁndings, Nagamoto et al. [152] investigated the effects of daily intake of
rose hip extracts on pre-obese volunteers. They observed that this supplementation contributed
to reducing the levels of abdominal visceral fat without any undesirable side effects. Thus, they
conﬁrmed the previous ﬁndings in animal models and proposed Rosa canina as a promising candidate
for anti-obese therapies.
3.7. Renal Disturbances
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a disorder characterized by a disruption of regular kidney
function that causes renal failure. Since two of the major causes of AKI are oxidative stress and
inﬂammation [153], the previously described antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties of rose hip
make it an interesting therapeutic option for AKI. Using a rat model, Ashtiyani et al. [154] investigated
the effect of Rosa canina oral administration in AKI induction, and observed a decrease in oxidative
stress that correlated well with the observed reduction of renal damage.
Similar results were obtained by Zhao et al. [155] using ﬂavonoids extracted from Rosa laevigata.
In this particular case, they observed that incubation with Rosa laevigata ﬂavonoids reduced ROS levels
in renal tubular duct epithelial cells from rat (NRK-52E), which correlated with a protective effect on
kidney injury. This decrease in ROS levels seems to be related to an increase in certain redox enzymes
including superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, anti-inﬂammatory properties of
ﬂavonoids were also involved in attenuation of AKI, since incubation with them resulted in a decrease
in the expression of NF-κB related genes. Finally, they tested the effect of Rosa laevigata ﬂavonoids on
rat models and conﬁrmed their nephroprotective effect.
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common diabetes-associated injuries and it is related
to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species [156]. Encouraged by this fact, Zhou et al. [157] studied
the effect of Rosa laevigata administration to diabetic rats. Treatment with Rosa laevigata reduced reactive
oxygen species levels via increasing superoxide dismutase levels-like Zhao et al. [155] observed-,
which eventually resulted in an ameliorative effect from renal injury. Once again, the expression
of NF-κB related genes decreased after incubation with Rosa laevigata, showing unambiguously the
anti-inﬂammatory potential of this plant.
Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is a polygenic disorder whose incidence is rising worldwide every day.
Kidney stones are usually removed using extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, although this technique
may involve undesirable side effects. Currently, there is an important lack of drugs for the prevention
and treatment of this disease. Researchers have consequently focused on developing prevention
strategies in order to avoid calcium oxalate stones formation [158,159]. Tayeﬁ-Nasrabadi et al. [160]
used a nephrolithiasic rat model in order to test the effect of Rosa canina extracts on calcium oxalate
stones formation. They observed a decrease in calcium oxalate content in treated rats as well as a drop
in number of calcium oxalate calculi. This effect is supposed to be result of the antioxidant activity of
Rosa canina, since they found a signiﬁcant reduction in lipid peroxidation in kidney, one of the main
risk factor for nephrolithiasis. In conclusion, all data collected by Tayeﬁ-Nasrabadi et al. [160] show
the potential therapeutic role of Rosa canina in prevention and even treatment of nephrolithiasis.
3.8. Hepatotoxicity
Liver plays a key role in metabolism, detoxiﬁcation and energy storage in animals. Due to its
functions, this organ is highly exposed to multiple xenobiotics and suffers from high levels of oxidative
stress, which can cause deleterious effects to its function [161]. Despite its importance, hepatic diseases
are lacking in effective treatments nowadays, and herbal medicines are one of the main options for
prevention and therapy [162].

Many hepatic injuries are characterized by lipid peroxidation, generation of free radicals and
reduction of the activity of antioxidant enzymes. In clinic, this hepatic injury is turned into increased
serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP proteins and reduction of ALB and TB serum protein levels.
In vivo studies revealed that treatment with the fruit extract of Rosa canina at 500 and 750 mg/kg
doses restored the levels of these marker enzymes in a model of hepatic injury induced by CCl4.
Moreover, Rosa canina extracts attenuated the histopathological alteration produced by this compound.
It is thought that the mechanism of action of Rosa canina in liver diseases is based on its content in
antioxidants and phenolic compounds which can reduce the peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids
induced by CCl4, preventing the damage of cell membranes [163].
3.9. Neuroprotective Activity
Alzheimer is an age-related neurodegenerative disease inﬂuenced by genetic as well as
environmental factors which mainly affects the elderly population in developed countries. Its onset is
characterized by progressive memory loss accompanied by several changes in behaviour and cognition.
With regard to the molecular insights into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer, one of the best characterized
abnormalities from Alzheimer is the extracellular accumulation of amyloid β and the formation of
neuroﬁbrillary tangles composed by high amounts of hyperphosphorylated tau protein; this eventually
leads to on neural loss and gliosis [164]. ROS imbalance is supposed to play a relevant role in
Alzheimer development, since abnormal mitochondrial function and consequent oxidative stress have
been observed in Alzheimer disease. In this context, antioxidant therapy may be a promising tool for
treating this disorder [165].
At this moment, Rosa damascena is one of the most promising medicinal plants for Alzheimer
treatment. Esfandiary et al. [166] supplemented Alzheimer-induced rats with Rosa damascena extracts
and they found an improvement in spatial and long-term memory. The antioxidant properties of
ﬂavonoids content in these rose hips are the most likely elements responsible for their neuroprotective
effect, as they are supposed to inhibit the synthesis of amyloid β. Concretely, the ﬂavonoid myricetin
has shown the most relevant anti-Alzheimer potential, since it is able to avoid amyloid β formation
and has certain tau-antagonist activity. Moreover, its antioxidant properties seem to act as a protection
against neuronal damage [167,168].
In quite a similar way, oxidative stress is linked to other neurodegenerative diseases such as
epilepsy. The fact that lipid peroxidation has shown to have increased in epileptic patients, whereas
vitamins A and C plasma levels were found to be signiﬁcantly decreased, leads researchers to suppose
that antioxidant therapy may be helpful [169]. In fact, ﬂavonoid supplementation has been conﬁrmed
as a potential therapeutic tool for epileptogenesis due to its intrinsic antioxidant properties previously
discussed. In addition, some ﬂavonoids are able to bind the GABAA-Cl channel complex, acting as
anticonvulsive agents [170].
The anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects from Rosa damascena were resumed by
Homayoun et al. [171] using a rat model. Rosa damascena extracts administration ameliorated convulsions and
also reduced the formation of dark neurons, consequently improving memory impairments. Dark neurons
are commonly observed in brain-related diseases, and their apparition seems to be linked to oxidative
stress [172], so the neuroprotective effect of Rosa damascena may be caused by its antioxidant activity.
Aromatherapy has been proposed as adjuvant therapy for the management of psychiatric
disorders including anxiety or depression.
Beneﬁts of aromatherapy are due to the chemical
composition of essential oils, which contain volatile organic compounds capable of stimulating
different central nerve system areas. This stimulation leads to a release of neurotransmitters, for
example serotonin, responsible for the observed pro-relaxing effects [173]. Along these lines, relaxing
properties of Rosa damascena oil have been reported [174] and consequently might have a promising
future in psychiatric disorders treatment.
Mostly of the depression-induced brain damages are related to an overproduction of ROS in the
brain that triggers cell death. Therefore, high antioxidant content of rose hip makes it a potential and


--- Page 18 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
18 of 37
powerful help for treatment of depression. Nazıro˘glu et al. [175] found that Rosa damascena inhalation
reduced lipid peroxidation levels in depressed rat cerebral cortex, proving the potential of rose hip in
the management of depression.
3.10. Skin Disorders and Aging
One of the most common skin disorders is atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inﬂammatory disorder
that mainly affects children. Treatments for skin lesions associated with this disease are focused on a
suppressed inﬂammatory response, but most therapies are just temporal because of the side effects
associated to long time exposure [176]. In order to improve quality-of-life for thousands of infants
worldwide, new anti-AD drugs are needed, in order to ﬁnd a deﬁnitive solution to this problem
without deleterious effects.
Topical application of extracts from Rosa multiﬂora root extracts improved AD-like injury in
mice [177]. Anti-AD activity of Rosa multiﬂora seems to be related to its anti-inﬂammatory properties,
since application of extracts reduced mRNA levels of inﬂammatory mediators cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2) and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS). Moreover, rose hip treatment avoided allergic
response derived from AD by decreasing blood eosinophil ratio and plasmatic IgE levels. Finally,
Rosa multiﬂora showed an interesting regulatory effect of Th2-immune response, as serum levels of Th2
were signiﬁcantly decreased after treatment. Nowadays, the most effective anti-AD drugs are those
focused on suppressing Th2-polarized immune system [176], so these ﬁndings suggest a promising
future for Rosa multiﬂora in atopic dermatitis treatment. Of the different components that can be found
in Rosa multiﬂora roots, the most likely candidate to act against AD is the condensed tannin RM-3.
RM-3 is the most abundant phytochemical in Rosa multiﬂora root extract, and Park et al. [177] proved
that this isolated tannin reproduced the effects previously observed for the whole extract.
Skin aging is due to the majority contribution of two factors: on the one hand, chronic aging
associated with time, and on the other hand, the commonly so called photoaging caused by UV
exposition. The combination of both conditions results in a loss of functionality of skin barrier and
in the acquisition of unsightly features such as dryness, wrinkles and spots [178]. The previously
discussed antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties of rose hip make it a promising aid in reducing
these skin aging signs.
Fuji et al. [34] investigated the effect of quercetin isolated from Rosa canina on melanogenesis in
B16 mouse melanoma cells. Melanin is responsible for the pigmentation of human skin, hair and eyes,
but its excessive biosynthesis leads to skin disorders like age spots or melanoma [179]. The key enzyme
in this process is tyrosinase, and quercetin from Rosa canina was found to be capable of inhibiting
its activity and consequently reduced melanin content of mouse melanoma cells. Interestingly, this
reduction in melanin content was not related to a decrease in cell viability, a key point for their potential
application in the cosmetic industry. Later, the oral administration of rose hip extracts to brown guinea
pigs decreased skin pigmentation, proving their melanogenesis inhibitor effects in vivo and suggesting
the potential use of Rosa canina as a skin-lightening agent in cosmetic [180].
Phetcharat et al. [181] tested the activity of a commercially available Rosa canina powder upon
aging-related effects. They carried out a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial on healthy
middle-aged male and female volunteers and studied the effect of rose hip powder on (1) skin wrinkles
and (2) red blood cells longevity. Regarding the ﬁrst part of their study, rose hip powder reduced the
depths of crow’s-feet wrinkles, increased moisture content of forehead and improved skin elasticity.
On the other hand, Rosa canina powder reduced red cell membrane disintegration and, as a result,
increased cell longevity. The anti-aging effects of Rosa canina are related to its antioxidant properties, as
certain phytochemicals are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced by UV-radiation and so
reduce skin damage. Vitamin C might have a dual role in skin protection since as well as its antioxidant
effect; it is directly involved in skin and collagen formation. Moreover, the anti-inﬂammatory effect
of some components of Rosa canina is also related to protection from UV-induced inﬂammation and


--- Page 19 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
19 of 37
damage. Finally, antioxidant compounds and poly-unsaturated fatty acids are the major contributors
to Rosa canina effects on increasing red cell longevity, as both prevent cell membrane damage.
Part of the anti-aging effect of rose hip is due to its activity as PPAR-α agonist. PPAR-α is involved in
inﬂammatory processes, since its activation leads to an inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory genes expression
like matrix metalloproteases (MMP). The normal function of MMP has been described earlier, which
consists of degrading components of extracellular matrix [96]. Consequently, MMPs also play a key
role in photoaging, whose synthesis is increased after UV exposure [182]. Results from Jeon et al. [183]
agreed with this hypothesis: they observed that Rosa multiﬂora extracts act as PPAR-α agonist which
induced a decrease in MPP expression levels, ameliorating photoaging-related effects on murine skin.
Oxidative stress is not the only thing responsible for skin damage, as psychological stress induces
deleterious effects on skin barrier, as well. Some of the reported effects are a delay in skin barrier function
recovery, an increase in the number and activity of natural killer cells and an increase in the release
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-β [184]. Evidences of the anxiolytic effect of rose
hip have been previously discussed [174], but these data provide a new perspective on the beneﬁcial
effect of Rosa species for skin health. Relaxing properties of Rosa damascena oil inhalation resulted in a
decrease in transepidermial water loss, a common skin damage feature induced by chronic stress [185].
3.11. Diarrhoeal
Diarrhoea is deﬁned as a situation in which an adult daily stool exceeds 200 g and contains 60–95%
water [186] and it constitutes one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing
countries [187], where people still rely on healing practices and medicinal plants. As a result, despite
the advances of Modern Medicine, the World Health Organization encouraged studies for the treatment
and prevention of diarrheal diseases depending on traditional medical practices.
In vivo studies showed that the methanol extract Rosa canina had a signiﬁcant antidiarrhoeal
activity mediated by an antisecretory mechanism that induce a ﬂuid accumulation comparable to
that obtained with the standard drug, diphenoxylate. Furthermore, Rosa canina extract signiﬁcantly
reduced intestinal transit, thereby increasing the absorption of water and electrolytes [188].
The molecular mechanism underlying the antidiarrheal activity of Rosa canina extract could be
based on the inhibition of acetylcholine and histamine through some secondary metabolites present in
the leaf extract, such as ﬂavonoids [187–190], and saponins [188].
Although further studies are needed to identify the active principle responsible for the anti-diarrhoeal
activity of Rosa canina, its use could constitute a potential therapy for this intestinal alteration.
3.12. Anti-Ulcerogenic Effect
Peptic ulcer disease is an increasing incidence disorder that presents epigastric pain among other
common symptoms such as bloating or nausea. It is considered to be a multifactorial disorder which
ﬁnally derives in a loss of the protective mucosal barrier. Although there are various risk factors
associated with the onset of ulcer disease, most of the cases are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection
and so treatment is focused on antibiotic therapy [189].
Anti-ulcerogenic effect from Rosa canina extracts was first discovered by Gürbüz et al. [190]. By
inducing ulcerogenesis on rat models, they observed that Rosa canina were able to totally prevent ulcer
formation. However, they did not propose any mechanism of action that explains the observed effects.
Lattanzio et al. [191] went deeper in their studies and observed that treatment with Rosa canina prevented
gastric mucosa erosion and avoided haemorrhagic ulcer formation. They propose that the antioxidant
activity of rose hip extracts—which was conserved even at gastric acid pH—was responsible for the
results obtained, since lipid peroxidation and ROS production are highly involved in gastric damage.
3.13. Antimicrobial Effect
Infectious diseases have a great impact on world health and the worrying and increasing rates
of antibiotic resistance intensify pharmaceutical industry research for new drugs in order to solve


--- Page 20 ---
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
20 of 37
this emergency situation [192]. In this context, plant phenolic compounds are an interesting source of
new antibiotics, especially against Gram-positive bacteria. Regarding their mechanism of action, due
the wide variety of structures they possess, each compound interacts with a different cell component.
Some of the best characterized phenolic-induced antibacterial effects include increase of membrane
permeabilisation, nutrients deprivation and extracellular enzymes inhibition [193].
The antibacterial effect of some rose hip species was roughly investigated in Gram positive and
Gram negative bacteria strains [192–196], as shown in Tables 3–5. Interestingly, these tests conﬁrmed
the presence of antimicrobial compounds in different parts of the plant, as they investigated the
effects of ﬂowers [193], seeds [194] and fruits [193,195]. Results from Olech et al. [195] focus on the
correlation between antioxidant capacity from rose hip extracts—due to their phenolic content—and
their antibacterial potential. The mechanism of action they propose is an energy deprivation caused by
a hyperacidiﬁcation of plasma membrane interface that disrupts H+-ATPase.

Other authors advocate the existence of single antimicrobial agents rather than a combination of
distinct compounds. In this line, Miyasaki et al. [197] highlight the antibacterial role of ellagic acid from
Rosa rugosa, a phenolic compound with a moderate effect against Acinetobacter baumanii. Ellagic acid is
supposed to downregulate polyphosphatase kinase 1 (PPK1) gene expression as well as its activity,
an enzyme with a crucial role in virulence [198]. The adjunctive use of rose hip-derived compounds
is also interesting in order to potentiate the activity of existing drugs. Accordingly, tellimagrandin I
extracted from Rosa canina enhanced the effect of the β-lactam antibiotic oxacillin against multi-drug
resistant Staphylococcus aureus [199]. This phytochemical is able to inhibit penicillin binding protein 2′
(PBP2), a bacterial enzyme responsible to resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.

The role of Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer disease onset has been mentioned earlier [189] and
the anti-ulcerogenic potential of Rosa canina, but the beneﬁts from rose hip in ulcer treatment might go
further. Results from Horváth et al. [200] showed that some carotenoids from Rosa canina had certain
anti-Helicobacter pylori activity. They observed that one of the most abundant carotenoid was lycopene,
whose antioxidant activity is a key factor in Helicobacter pylori eradication [201]. As ROS scavenger,
lycopene prevents oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in infected gastric cells and consequently
inhibits apoptosis [2]. These facts put together with the previous ﬁndings of Gürbüz et al. [187] and
Lattanzio et al. [191] suggest that Rosa canina may be a powerful tool not only in ulcer treatment but also
in its prevention, as rose hip extracts might reduce Helicobacter pylori burden before damage apparition.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a set of disorders characterized by a high burden of one or
more bacteria strain and even fungi in any part of the genitourinary tract. When not treated correctly,
UTIs can promote other diseases such as pyelonephritis, especially if infectious bacteria contain urease.
Urease normal function consists of urea hydrolysis to ammonium and carbon dioxide. This results
in pH alkalization that promotes calcium crystals and magnesium ammonium phosphates stones
formation [202,203]. Urease inhibitors are as a result an interesting drug approach to UTIs management.
Bai et al. [204] reported the urease inhibitory effect of Rosa indica extracts as well as their
antimicrobial effect displayed against ﬁve bacteria strain commonly found in UTIs. The authors
did not delve into the concrete phytochemical that performs this inhibition, but the anti-urease activity
of certain phenolic compounds has been well demonstrated [205]. Therefore, phenolic content of Rosa
indica are the most likely urease inhibitor agents. Moreover, results from Bai et al. [204] might also be
included within the previous section of “Renal disturbances”, since by preventing from crystals and
stones formation they indirectly avoid nephrolithiasis or other kidney injuries.
Gut microbiome is a complex variety of microorganisms, mainly bacteria, that colonizes the
digestive tract and establishes a symbiotic relationship with the human body. Antibiotics intake or
dietary changes affect microbiome composition and might lead to a situation of dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is
characterized by an increase in potentially harmful bacteria accompanied by a decrease in protective
microorganisms, and it is considered to be one of the main causes of intestinal disorders such as
inﬂammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer [206]. An ideal antibiotic would only affect pathogenic
bacteria without disturbing normal colonic ﬂora, but pharmacologic industry has not reached that
stage yet. However, traditional medicine might be closer to that point than might be expected.
Rosa rugosa has been proven to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria but did not alter
biﬁdobacteria or lactobacilli growth [207]. The antimicrobial effect of phenolic compounds mentioned
above [208] seems to be selective, since Kamijo et al. [207] observed that tannins from Rosa rugosa only
inhibited pathogenic bacteria growth, suggesting Rosa rugosa as a promising prebiotic.
The antiviral effect of rose hip has been less investigated, but some interesting research has also
been performed in this ﬁeld. In 1995, the protective effect of Rosa nutkana extracts against bovine
coronavirus was reported [65]. No further information about the anti-coronavirus effect of Rosa nutkana
has been added up to the present, although it directed other researchers to evaluate the antiviral
potential of Rose gender members.
Certain phytochemicals from Rosa rugosa showed anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity by
inhibiting its capacity to invade hepatocytes. Tellimagrandin, previously mentioned because of
its enhancing effect of β-lactam antibiotics action, was able to bind two envelope proteins responsible
for HCV invasive capacity [209]. The HCV invasion inhibition shown by tellimagrandin must be
conﬁrmed in vivo, but at this moment is a promising drug for hepatitis treatment. These ﬁndings
bring a new point of view to our previous statements about hepatotoxicity, since the antiviral effect of
rose hip would indirectly give protection from hepatic injury.
But undoubtedly, one of the greatest viral epidemics of our time is the Acquired Immune
Deﬁciency Syndrome or AIDS. In 2013, approximately 35 million people were infected with human
immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-related deaths were around 1.5 million. Although
pharmacological progress has greatly improved the quality-of-life of these patients, we are still quite


--- Page 22 ---

22 of 37
far from AIDS eradication [210]. Current drugs inhibit distinct enzymes from the replicative life cycle
of HIV in order to improve treatment efﬁcacy. As a result, antiretroviral therapies are a combination
of two or three drugs including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonists and/or fusion
inhibitors. However, therapy does not completely eradicate HIV and virus mutations are an additional
complication [211]. In conclusion, there is an urgent need to develop new HIV drugs that could reduce
the global burden of this disease.
Rosa rugose has been investigated as a source of new anti-HIV agents. A polysaccharide-peptide
complex and a polymer comprised of acteoside and acteoside derivatives showed strong inhibitory
effect upon viral retrotranscriptase [212]. These ﬁndings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of rose
hip in HIV eradication.
The anti-mycotic effect of rose hip has also been evaluated and most relevant results are shown in
Tables 6–8. More profound studies proved that this effect may be related to ursane-type triterpene
glucosides content of Rose gender members [213].

4. Conclusions
Reactive oxygen species as well as nitrogen reactive species, have a key function as signalling
molecules, regulating a wide variety of cellular processes. However, an imbalance between ROS and
NOS levels and the antioxidant defence system leads to oxidative stress, which induces cell damage
and is the main cause of different pathologies. As a result, maintaining redox balance is essential
for the correct functioning of the whole organism. When ROS levels overcome the endogenous
defences, mainly constituted by peroxidases and metal chelating proteins, dietary intake of exogenous
antioxidants is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment6 of these ROS-dependent diseases.
In this review, Rosa genus has been presented as a natural source of antioxidants with a potential
use in disease prevention and treatment. Rosa genus stands out for its high content in polyphenols
(such as garlic acid, catechin and quercetin), vitamins C, E, B and carotenoids (β-carotenoid, lycopene
β-cryptozanthin, rubizanthin, zeazanthin and lutein), which have an antioxidant synergy effect.
The concentration of all these bioactive molecules depend on different factors such as the variety of
Rosa, part of the plant, type of fertilization, date of harvesting, geographical origin, among others.
Nevertheless, rose hip showed higher antioxidative properties than other well-known antioxidant
fruits as rowanberry (S. aucuparia), hawthorn (C. monogyna), chokeberry (A. melanocarpa), blackcurrant
(R. nigrum), and blueberry (V. myrtillus). In addition, besides its antioxidants molecules, Rosa genus is
rich in other bioactive compounds such as unsaturated fatty acids or galactolipids, which have been
proven to ameliorate different types of disease. Considering the high content of bioactive molecules

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1137
23 of 37
contained in Rosa genus, rose hip has an interesting potential for the treatment of different disorders
related to oxidative stress or pro-inﬂammatory status.
Galactolipids contained in rose hip contributed to NO scavenging, playing an anti-tumour role.
Methanol extracts and antioxidants from this plant also proved to have an antitproliferative activity
in different cell lines through the disruption of ROS balance. Other mechanisms of rose hip action in
cancer includes inhibition of transcription activity and reduction of cell migration.
In bone diseases, such as AR, rose hip displays a beneﬁcial anti-inﬂammatory effect by reducing
peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leucocytes, neutrophils and monocytes migration, demising the
CRP levels, inhibiting of COX-1 and -2, reducing pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines and
inhibiting the activation of NF-κB activation. Moreover, rose hips also play a beneﬁcial an antioxidant
role and reduce bone loss through the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in osteoporosis,
antioxidants reduce loss of whole-body BMD and ascorbic acid contributes to osteoblast differentiation.
In diabetes, antioxidants and vitamin E contained in rose hip extract could ameliorate the
secondary complications of this disease. Rosa canina has also been proven to increase proliferation
of β-pancreatic cells and increase the number of pancreatic islets in vivo. Other beneﬁts from rose
hip extracts are due to its ability to inhibit α-amilases and α-glucosidades, which reduce the glucose
blood levels in a similar way to α-glucosidase inhibitors currently used in diabetes type II treatment.
Moreover, rose hips extracts decreased the levels of serum triglycerides and hepatic lipids whereas
serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein levels were not modiﬁed.
Finally, trans-tiliroside contained in Rosa canina increased the expression of PPARα and reduced the
levels of PPARγ resulting in an increase of lipid metabolism linked to a decrease in adipogenesis, and
hence a reduction of abdominal visceral fat in pre-obese people.
Due to its high content in anti-oxidative molecules, rose hip extracts have demonstrated a
protective effect in other disorders associated with a disruption in redox balance such as AKI, DN,
hepatotoxicity or peptic ulcer disease. Vitamins A and C, together with other ﬂavonoids of Rosa
damascena ameliorate convulsions in epilepsy. Moreover, ﬂavonoid contained in Rosa damascena extracts,
especially the ﬂavonoid myricetin, avoid amyloid β formation and hence they can be neuroprotective
in Alzheimer. Finally, antioxidants and essential oils found in Rosa damascena proved its potential in
depression managing. Rose hip extracts have also proved to have anti-inﬂammatory activity, and
hence they could constitute a potential therapy in diseases associated with an enhanced inﬂammatory
response, such as AD or skin aging.
Methanol extract Rosa canina had a signiﬁcant antidiarrheal activity mediated by an antisecretory
mechanism that reduce intestinal transit thereby increasing the absorption of water and electrolytes
and inducing ﬂuid accumulation [186].
Finally, phenols contained in rose hip extracts have an antibacterial activity, being able to increase
membrane permeabilisation, nutrient deprivation and extracellular enzyme inhibition. Antiviral and
antifungal properties of Rosa spp. have also been reported.
Our present research has underlined the promising future of rose hip as a functional food, given
its potential therapeutic role against a wide variety of diseases. The phytochemical composition of the
different members of the Rose gender might promote the eradication of some of the most pressing
world epidemics, as well as improve the quality-of-life of even healthy people. Moreover, single
bioactive compounds of rose hip constitute a great source for new drugs which might overcome
resistance-derived problems in some current drugs or even treat incurable diseases. However, it is
important to notice that most of the researches that we have reviewed herein have been realized on
cell culture. Therefore, the results obtained must be further conﬁrmed in vivo. (Table 9) In this line,
the most promising future for Rosa spp. in therapy lies in those disorders that have been tested using
animal models or even human volunteers, e.g., acute kidney injury. The clinical application of Rosa
gender members might be closer in these cases.

ABSTRACT
==================================================

medicinal compounds for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. The therapeutic potential of these plants is based on its antioxidant effects caused by or associated with its phytochemical composition, which includes ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds and healthy fatty acids among others. Over the last few years, medicinal interest in rose hips has increased as a consequence of recent research that has studied its potential application as a treatment for several diseases including skin disorders, hepatotoxicity, renal disturbances, diarrhoea, inﬂammatory disorders, arthritis, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and cancer. In this review, the role of different species of Rosa in the prevention of treatment of various disorders related to oxidative stress, is examined, focusing on new therapeutic approaches from a molecular point of view.
