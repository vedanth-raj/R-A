ABSTRACT
In 
collected spectrometer data were used to evaluate and quantify
the relationships between the various linear combinations of red and photo-
graphic infrared radiances and experimental plot biomass, Ieaf water content,
Mid chlorophyll content. The radiance variables evaluated included the red
end photographic infrared (ir) ►alliance and the linear combinations of the ir/
red ratio, the square root of the it/red ratio, the it-red difference, the vegetation
index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding
green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparilive purposes.
Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling period,.
Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the it and ►ed linear
combinations vis-a-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red
and it linear combinations had 7% and 14% greater regression significant than
the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling
periods, respectively.
The VI, TVI, and square root of the it/red ratio were the most significant
followed closely by the it/red ratio. Less than 6% difference separated the
highest and lowest of these four it and red linear combinations. The use of
these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green

RED AND PIIOTOGRAPHIC INFRARED LINEAR COMBINATIONS
FOR MONITORING VEGETATION
INTRODUCTION
The use of photographic infrared (ir) and red linear combinations for monitoring
vegetation biomass and physiological status have recently become common in the remote
sensing community. Accompanying tlus increased usage, however, has been a lack of
detailed analyses concerning limitations of these data and their applicat,.m(s) to vegetation
monitoring. Quantitative information regarding the various it and red linear combinations
and the constraints involved in the use of these methods will enable more advantageous
application of these techniques. It will also prevent over-ambitious use of these techniques
when other methods would be more applicable. I will examine ground-collected grass
canopy spectra in an . ttempt to quantify the relationship between the it and red linear
combinations and properties of plant canopies.
PREVIOUS WORK
The use of near infrared/red ratio method for estimating biomass or leaf area index
was first reported by Jordan (1969) who used a radiance ratio of 0.800/0.675 pill to
derive the leaf area index for forest canopies in a tropical rain forest. This application
of the it/red ratio used the transmitted light at these wavelengths which was sensed on
the forest floor (Jo rdan, 069). Subsequent work was reported by Pearson and Miller
(1972) who developed a hand-held spectral radiometer for estimating grass canopy biomass.
The instrumentation aspect of the hand-held radiometer is described in Pearson et al.
(1976).


--- Page 10 ---
Colwell 0973 and 1974) presented a detailed study of bidirectional spectral reflect-
Mice of pass canopies. lie concluded that the it/red ratio was effective in somewhat
normalizing the effect of soil background reflectance variation(s) and was useful for
estimating biomass. Colwell also cautioned that the ir!red ratios may worsen angular
effects rather than alleviate them under certain conditions. Smith and Oliver (1974)
, corroborated several of Colwell's ( 1 973 and 1974) conclusions using it stochastic
,anopy model vers e.... Colwell's use of Suits' (1972) deterministic canopy model.
"Ilse it/red ratio method has been applied to Landsat image analysis of range biomass
by Reuse et al. ( 1973 and 1974). C'arneggie et al. ( 1974), Johnson ( 1976), and Maxwell
(1976), among others.
Carneggie et al. (1974) used it ratio of Landsat MSS7;MSS5 and found that the
ratio curves, piotted as a function of time, peaked during the period of greatest forage
production. 'lltereafter, the curves fell off signalling the period of drying following the
maximum green period for their California study site. Once the curves had leveled off,
Carneggie et al. (1974) concluded that all annual vegetation had dried.
Rouse et al. 11973 and 1974) analyzed Landsat MSS data and developed what
they referred to as the vegetation index (V1) and transformed vegetation index (TVI).
They found that although a simple ratio of MSS7/MSS5 could be used as it
of relative greenness, location and cycle deviations would introduce a large error component.
Me difference of the MSS7-MSS5 radiance values, normalized over the suns of MSS7 +
MSS5, was used as an Index value and was christened the V1.

(2)
Vie VI and TVi were then applied to [.andsat data. MSS bands 6 and 7 were both
evaluated as the near infrared band. Rouse et al. (1974) reached several conclusions.
Among them were: ( 1) that [Andsat VI and TV[ methods could lx used to monitor
rangelands and wheat crops; (2) the close relationship between g reen biomass and TVI
should allow researchers to follow crop development as ground cover, biomass, and leaf
area indices increase; and (3) phonological inferences :ol.ild possibly be gleaned for certain
crops or range types and used to monitor these types of vegetation (Rouse et al. 1974).
Johnston (1976) and Maxwell (1(,76) also analyzed Landsat imagery using ratio
methods. They concluded that the ratio of MSS6/MSS5 was slightly more statistically
significant than MSS7/MSS5 and that both ratios were useful in monitoring green biomass.
An explanation of the apparent greater utility of MSS6 vs MSS7 for rangeland biomass
estimation in low biomass situations based upon soil-gyeen vegetation spectral contrasts
has been proposed by Tucker and Miller (1977).
Other researchers have also used the VI for Landsat analyses. Blair and Baumgardner
(1977) monitored several hardwood forest sites using Landsat imagery. They used the VI,
which they refer to as the "band ratio parameter," and hound that the gro-enwave effect
could be monitored for these vegetation types using Landsat imagery.

Asnlcy and Rea (1975) reported how L mdsat MSS5 and %ISS7 data were used to
depict plhenolokical change. 'They also uwd the VI and found that it increased with
foliage development and decreased with senescence. PIC VI w:rPs found .o reduce in-
fluencing multiplicative effects such as solar elevation differences between overpasses
(Ashley and Rea 1975).
In addition to the above reviewed l.andsat analyses. Kauth and Thomas (1976)
arid Richardson and Wiegand (1 177) have proposed L.andsat vegetational analytical
methods using, at least in part, it and red linear combinations.
Richardson and Wicgand (1977) have proposed a departure from the soil background
line with the perpendicular ,!getation index (PVI):
PVI = v1 -
(Red  Soil - Red veg)' r OR Soil - I R veg )2 (3)
where:
Red S,,il = soil background red reflectance or radiant,.-
Red veg 
= vegetation back g7ound red retleztance or radiance
IR"Al 
= soil background it reflectance or radiance
1R Ve2 
= vegetation background it retlectance or radiance
Kauth and Thomas (1976) have developed a technique for transforming Landsat M';S
information in foie-dimension data space using the four MSS bands. from this, a soil
brightness index (SBI) and green vegetation index (C.VI) were calculated as follows:
S111 = 0.43*MSS4 + 0.63*MSS5 + 0.5 1)*MSS6 + 0.26*MSS7 
(4)
and
(;Vl = -0.29*MSS4 - 0.56*MSS5 + 0.60*MSS6 + 0.49*MSS7

Note that all the Slil independent variable .06ficients are positive while the GVI in-
dependent 
7ASS4 and %ISS5 are negative. The SBI eitabiishes the data space
of soils and the G %71 departs from it, in a negative or absorptive fashion with \ISS4 and
MSS5, approxim"►tely the same coefficients for MSSO for both models, and a lossitive
departure for MSS7. This aim) follows from Figure I.
Deering (1 Q78), in a recent and comprehensive analysis of Landsat rangeland biomass
monitoring has reported that the VI and TAI approaches hr evaluated were slightly
more significant with respect to green biomass than the PVI of Wiegand and Richardson
(1977) and the GVI of Kautli and Thomas (1970). In addition, Deering ( 1978) reported
9 
that the denominator of the V1 and TVI (i.e., MSS5 + MSS6 or MSS5 + MSS7) were
highly correlated (r > 0.05) to Kauth and Thomas' 11976) sail brightness index (Still.

ma; -itv of jr and red linear combination work have used Landsat data.
!"Memasu (1974), however, rcpx,its on a ground-bawd reflectance study of crop types
where various ratios were investigated. Wheat, sorghum, and soybean plots were moni-
toted periodically during the growing s.asem using a spectrom.ter. Kanemasu (1974) co n-
eluded the 0.545/0.655 pm wavebands provided useful information regardless of crop
type. For all crops studied, the green/red ratio closely followed crop growth and develop-
ment and appeared to be inore desirable than the near-infrared reflectance as an index
of growth. The grc:­/rca ratio will be evaluated in this paper also.
Recent work by Nalepka et al. (1977) and Tucker et al. (1975) have used it and red
Jjta to forecast winter wheat yields and monitor agricultural crop vigor and condiU,)n,
respectively. Nalepka et al. (1977) evaluated various green measures using Landsat data
and cop.-e-eded that most are useful but stress that no new information is created. Tucker
, 19/5 1, monitored several crop types using a hand-held radiometer.

It is perhaps prudent to briefly review the basic properties of the 1r and red radiances
with respect to green vegetation before embarking on a 'Aaded analysis of the various
linear combinations.
Me red radiance exhibits the nonlinear inverse relationship between integrated
spectral radiance an(! green biomass while the near infrared component exhibits a non-
linear direct relationship.

The relationship betwe-vii the 0.03 - 0.69 pm radiance and green hioniass results from
strong spectral absorption of incident radiation by the chlorophyll,. It is apparent that a
spectral radiance asymptote is mo:e quickly reached for the 0.0 - 0.09 pin red radiance
than the 0.75 - 0.P0 um near infnncd radmace 01gure 2) (Gausman et al , 1976. Tucker
1977x).
The 0.0 - O.he1 pin radiance is inversely proportion.il to the amount of chlorophyll
present in the plant canopy and thus is sensitive to green or photosynthetically active veget-
ation pr wnt.
17te 0.75 - 0.90 pnf radiance is sensitive to green or photosynthetically active vegeta-
tion and, to a lesser extent, the dead or noriphowsynlhetically active vegetation (Colwell,
1974: Tucker, 1977b and 1978).
The relationship between the 0.75 - OM pin infrared radiance and biomass results
from the lack of appreciabl e spectral absorption in the 0.74 - 1.10 pin region and the higli
Oegree of mtra- and interleaf scattering fit
 plant canopy. In the absence of spectra!
absorption, p! -.)ortionally more incident spe-ual radiance escapes from the canopy than is
absorbed. Thus the spectral radiance in the 0.74 - 1.10 pin region is said to be en:fanced or
increased over the level t)!' radiance of the background material.
Discrimination of vegetation hioniass is strongly dependent upon the soil surface-veg-
etation spectral reflectance or radiance contrast (C:olwe11. 1974). For this reason, softie
wavelengths are I'm sup .• rior to others I'm discrimination of green vegetation biomass

ratio, the Aluare rout of chic it/red ratio, the VI, and TVI are sensitive to the photosyntheti-
cally active biomass or the green leaf area present in the grass canopy. This is evident from
the June d.,ta where — 8Wr of the canopy was green or alive and only — 2017r) was standing
dead vegetation (Table 1). For this data set, the dry brown biomass canopy variable had the
lowest r'- when regressed against any of the nine it and red radiance variables evaluated (Table.
3; Figure 4).
The September data, comprised of-52% live and — 48% dead vegetation (Table 1),
ilso showed the lowest r2 values for the dry brown biomass canopy variable when regressed
against any of the nine it and red radiance variables (Table 3; Figures 5 and 6).
This confirms quantitatively that the it/red ratio, the square root of the it/red ratio,
the it-red difference, the V1, and the TVI are primarily sensitive to the green leaf material
or photosynthetically active biomass present in the plant canopy.
The it-red difference, TVI, V1, square root of the it/red ratio, and it/red showed the
greatest regression significance for the June and September data sets (Table 3). The it-red
difference can be excluded from further consideration because it will not compensate for
different irradiational conditions.
A 4% range existed between the it/red ratio, the square root of the it/red ratio, V1, and
TVI for the June data in terms of explaining greater regression variability. A 6% range
existed for the September Ieaf water content variable and the it/red, square root of the it/red,
VI, and TVI regressions, respectively (Table 3).

The October d. ►ta demonstrated conclusiveh t hat the var..., ►S green vegetation measures
do not have a ►)plicability to dormant vegetation (Table 3; Figure 7).
The l ►so of' the square root transformation for the it/red ratio INalepka et al., 1977) and
TVI (Rouse et al., 1973 and 1974) needs to be examined. Rouse et al. (1973 and 1974)
suggest that (tic distribution of the VI is Possion while Nalepka et al, ( 1 977) suggest that the
square root of it/red ratio is more linear. The data analysis for th,, June data shows the same
fun gi tional relationship(s) between the total wet bionic s and it/red ratio and square root of
the it/red ratio with the sanie asymptotic nature for both plots, resp:,ctively. The asymptotic
properties of the it/red ratio, square root of the it/red ratio, VI, and TVI are very sir.:ilar as
are the respective degrees of regression significance (Table 3: Figure 4).
PIIF.NOLO(;I('AI. CONSIDFRATIONS
Thi! spectral manifestations of grass canopy phonology can be inferred from the three
sampling periods used 1'or this study. Phenological development resulted in the gradual
accumulation of more standing vegetation in the grass canopy. By September there were
a pproxintately equal amounts of standing live and dead vegetation. The October data was
composed entirely of standing dead vegetation.
Spectral manifesta , ions of grass canopy phonology can be seen by comparing the various
radiance variables for the three sampling periods. The June analysis results were more signifi-
cant in a regression sense, showed the most nonlinearity, and had the highest degree of inter-
correlation between the six canopy variables ("fables 3 and 4). Canopy composition at this
time was —80% green vegetation and only " 30%: dead vegetation (Table 1).

The September analysis results were less significant in a regression sense than the J umc
ttsults, were linear. and had a lower degree of canopy variable intercorrelation than tlik•
June results( Table 3 and 4). Canopy composition at this time was-52",' green vegetation
and --48 ' dead vegetation (Table I ).
The October analysis results demonstrated t he need for sufficient chlorophyll absorp-
tion, to occur for the it/red ratio and related transformation% to work. By this sampling
time, canopy composition had simplified again and all the standing crop was standingdead
vegetation. Associated with this phenological condition were direct linear relationships be-
tween tx-)tlt the red and it radiances and each of the four canopy variables sampled at this
time. The regression results were not significant, except I -or three radiance variables, and
there was  higher degree of Canopy variable intercorrelation IIimi was the ease for the
Setiternber data (Tables ; and 4).
It should be noted that the "chlorophyll" determination for the Octobe ► ,.milllinp
period does not present in vivo chlorophyll a h b. It is thought to represent chlorophyll
decomposition products for this sampling period.
EVALUATION OF DIf FEREMU IK BANDWll) H IS
Another asl• ect of the study was to evaluate the influence of it bandwidth upon ratio
technique applications for estimating the various canopy variables for the .lime data. In
addition to the orilanal it handwidtIt of 0.75 - 0.80 {ant, the balldwidtllS of 0.80 - 0.90
and 0.75 - 0.90 /gy m were evaluated. No differences were found in regression significance
among the three it bandwidths for the .tune data (Table 5),

CONCLUSIONS
1. The it/red ratio and related irand red linear combinations were found to be superior
to the green/red ratio and related green and red linear comhuu►tions for monitoring; vegetation.
2. Thw it/red ratio, syuare root (4 the it/red ratio, it-red difference, VI, and TVI are
sensitive to the amount of photosynthetically active vegetation present in the plant canopy.
All were found to be very similar for estimating the photosynthetically active biomass.
3. The asymptotic properties of the it/red ratio, square root of the it/red ratio, it-red
difference, V1, and TVI were very similar for high green biomass situations. The square root
transformation did not result in a more linear situation.
4. The accumulation of standing dead vegetation in the canopy had a linearizing effect
upon the various green vegetation measures.
5. The regression significance for the different it bandwidths of 0.75 - 0.80, 0.80 -
0.90 and 0.75 - 0.90 pin were evaluated and I'ound to he extremely similar when used with
the red radiance or used in the various Linear combinations.
